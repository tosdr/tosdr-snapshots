<h2>Estes Express Lines Privacy Notice</h2>
<p><em>Effective <strong>December&nbsp;31, 2019</strong></em></p>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. We provide this notice so you will be aware of (1) the types of personal information we may collect when you use our website, (2) why we collect it, (3) how we use it, (4) how we protect it and (5) with whom we may share it. This notice also tells you how to contact us with any questions or concerns.</p>
<h3>Information You Provide</h3>
<p>You provide us with personal information while using certain features of this website. For example, if you request information or create a My Estes account, we ask for your contact details to enable us to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>Contact details include directory information such as your name, company address, phone number, fax details, and email address. If you have created a My Estes account, the details also include your username and password. We do not collect Social Security numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use other services, we will collect the information required to provide that service. For example, if you create an online Bill of Lading (BOL), we will collect the contact and delivery information for the person or entity who will receive delivery. Estes may collect other information on the site such as that which enables us to offer brokerage services with another carrier.</p>
<p>Our site also collects information you supply about a specific shipment. This permits authorized users access to tracking information or shipping documentation for the shipment.</p>
<p>We also collect other information to improve our services. For example, we collect feedback you provide in user or third-party surveys. Similarly, we collect location information if you access our site using a mobile device. We also collect general location information based on your IP address.</p>
<p>Finally, we collect data that you furnish us, or our service providers, to provide you with information and invoices. We may collect data to enable you to communicate with, and make payments through, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).</p>
<p>From time to time, we may change the website to offer additional products or services. If you decide to exploit these changes, you may choose to submit more information.</p>
<h3>Using the Information You Provide</h3>
<p>As explained above, we collect the personal or business information you supply us through this website. <strong>Note that you may choose not to provide us with all of the information we request</strong>. That said, such a choice may prevent us from providing you the services or information you request. In other cases, it may prevent you from taking full advantage of our site&rsquo;s features. The collected information is used for three main purposes.</p>
<p>First, we use it for business purposes. These functions involve the services you request. For example, this is used to create your My Estes account, generate quotes, process transactions, schedule pickups, track shipments, generate shipment/transaction-related documentation, view that documentation, handle shipment-related claims, and provide brokerage services for third parties to make shipments on your behalf. The data is also used to allow you to review billing information and open invoices.</p>
<p>In certain cases, you may make payments through Western Union. In those cases, your information will be submitted to, and processed by Western Union. <strong>Western Union&rsquo;s Privacy Policy will apply to such data. This Policy will not apply.</strong> For additional information about Western Union data processing practices, contact Western Union.</p>
<p>We may also use the data to communicate with you about our service offerings, as well as those of our affiliates and subsidiaries. We use it to gather your feedback about our products, services, and programs.</p>
<p>Second, we may use the information for technical purposes. For example, we may provide you with customized content based on your site usage, preferences, and location, along with other information you provide us.</p>
<p>We may also use the data to analyze and improve our online offerings, including website features, advertising, marketing communications, and to enhance our marketing strategy. This includes developing and customizing online advertisements for our services and those of our subsidiaries and affiliates. These advertisements are served to you on our website, on websites of our affiliates or subsidiaries, and on websites of third parties who participate in certain advertising networks with us.</p>
<p>Similarly, we may use the collected data to protect against fraud, physical damage, financial losses, and unauthorized transactions. We may also use it to handle claims, other liabilities, and manage risk. For example, we can use it to identify unauthorized users or security issues.</p>
<p>Finally, we use the information for other permitted legal purposes. For instance, we use it to comply with applicable laws, industry standards, and our internal policies. We may also use it to enforce and verify compliance with these laws, standards, and policies.</p>
<p>Similarly we use the information from our careers pages to assess applicants, make hiring decisions, and assist in other personnel management functions.</p>
<p>Note that we may combine the information we collect about you with data from other sources.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Automatic Data Collection</h3>
<p>We receive or collect some information automatically when you visit our site or engage with our online content. Certain third-party service providers such as Google Analytics may also collect this information for us. This information is collected using technology features such as:</p>

<p>In addition, we use this information to evaluate our web traffic, improve our website and services, enhance our communications, and understand the effectiveness of our ad or promotional campaigns. For more information on your choices about cookies, see the Your Choices section below.</p>
<p><em>Web Beacons.</em> We use web beacons or pixels that monitor some types of use. These beacons may provide us with information such as the IP address of the computer or other device that accessed the site. We use this information to understand activity patterns on our site, to improve site features, and to customize our content presentation, including online advertising.</p>

<h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>
<p>We may share information with trusted parties. This is done for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, we may share with other parties for business or operational reasons. These include our subsidiaries and affiliates. They also include third-party service providers that help us host and operate the website; gather, save, analyze and use information you enter into online forms; accept payments for services you order through the website; analyze data on website usage; send mail or email to you for marketing or promotional purposes; conduct surveys; or arrange for exchange of information and payments for shipping and other business purposes between you and Estes through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) services.</p>
<p>We also share with other carriers when you enter an online request for brokerage or time-critical services to help you place your shipment with another carrier. This is generally done if we cannot meet your needs in a particular situation.</p>

<p>Finally, we may share for legal reasons. For example, we share information when reasonably requested or required by law enforcement or government authorities. We also share where required to by law or in response to appropriate legal process. This includes instances in which sharing is necessary for an investigation into illegal activity, or to prevent physical harm or financial loss. Information will also be shared in the event of bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, or if we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.</p>
