<p><b>1. Information Collection and Use</b></p>
<p>MyBrowserAddon does NOT collect any personally identifiable information about You - such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address - unless You provide it to MyBrowserAddon voluntarily and approve its use.</p>
<p>If You do not want Your personally identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to MyBrowserAddon. When You do provide MyBrowserAddon with personally identifiable information, it may use that information to better understand Your needs and how it can improve its products and services. MyBrowserAddon may also use that information to contact You, for example, to answer a question or respond to a comment You have submitted. MyBrowserAddon reserves the right to display any questions or comments You submit, without reference to your identity, together with any responses MyBrowserAddon provides, on its frequently asked questions page found at //mybrowseraddon.com/faq.html. In the case of requests for new pages, MyBrowserAddon will use Your information to assess Your request, to verify Your identity and the identity of Your other project contributors, and for any other reasonable purposes in connection with Your request. However, it will not provide Your information to third parties without your consent, except as required by law as explained in the "Information Sharing" section below.</p>
<p>In some cases, MyBrowserAddon may collect information that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser or computer operating system You use, the date and time You visited the Site, the pages You accessed, and the name of the website from which You linked to the Site. MyBrowserAddon uses this information to analyze trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><b>2. Discussion and Social Plugins</b></p>
<p>The site has a discussion section for conversions and comments about hosted projects and general issues related to browser applications and extension development. We use Facebook Comments Plugin for this purpose.

<p>a. When participating in discussions, Your personal information may be publicly available through Your profile display, in which case You have the option to opt-out of publicly displaying Your real identity. Where site profiles allow users to display optional information publicly, such entry and display is at Your discretion and may be changed at any time by You.</p>
<p>b. The Site is an open-source site and the data and information hosted on the site is publically accessible by design. Anonymous messages (or posts that have been edited to be made anonymous) are against the spirit of open-source. When You offer content for other MyBrowserAddon users to read, attaching Your name to it gives other MyBrowserAddon users the ability to reply to You privately about it, in case they feel that a public reply would be inappropriate. If You want to avoid spam, use mail filters, or refrain from posting on the Site. MyBrowserAddon will not be responsible for any unsolicited email that You receive as a result of You posting Your email address on the newsgroups, discussions, or mailing lists.</p>
<p>c. This privacy policy does not protect any information that You transmit to newsgroups, discussions, mailing lists, or other users.</p>
