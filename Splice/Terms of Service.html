<h2>I. Introduction and Eligibility</h2>
<p class="p2">
Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service. Your use of, and participation in, the
Service may be subject to additional terms for specific Splice products, or tools such as Splice
Plugins, as further described below. You may be presented with supplemental terms and conditions for
your acceptance when you sign up to use a supplemental feature of the Service ("<b>Supplemental Terms</b
                    >”). Without limiting the foregoing, certain materials, tools, or components of the Service made
available through the Service (including premium add-ons and Plugins) may be subject to license
terms and conditions that are different from those set forth herein. Any such terms and conditions
will be identified for such materials, tools, or components of the Service, and by downloading same,
you agree to be bound by and comply with such Supplemental Terms.
</p>
<p class="p2">
If any provision in these Terms is inconsistent with any provision in the Supplemental Terms, the
provision in the Supplemental Terms shall control with respect to the applicable Service for which
the Supplemental Terms have been provided. The Terms and any applicable Supplemental Terms are
hereinafter referred to herein as the “Agreement.”
</p>
<h3>1. Revisions to the Agreement.</h3>
<p class="p2">
WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. PLEASE CHECK THESE
TERMS PERIODICALLY FOR CHANGES. When changes are made, Splice will make a new copy of the Agreement
available on the Website and within the Apps, or otherwise posted through the Services. We will also
update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. Any changes to the Agreement will be
effective immediately for new users of the Service and on the stated Effective Date for existing
Users (collectively, “<b>Users</b>”). Splice may require you to consent to the updated Agreement in
a specified manner before further use of the Service is permitted. In the event you do not agree to
any change(s) after receiving such notice thereof, you must stop using the Service. Otherwise, your
continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of such change(s).
</p>
<h3>2.1 Eligibility.</h3>
<p class="p2">
You must be at least 18 years old to create an account ("<b>Account</b>”) on the Service. If you
have obtained an Account solely through an enterprise or institutional license ("<b>Enterprise License</b
                    >”) (as further described in Section III(3) (Enterprise Accounts)), you must be at least 13 years
old to use the Service. By accessing or using the Service or otherwise agreeing to these Terms, you
represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old, or if you are under the age of
18 you have obtained consent from a parent or legal guardian to use the Service; (b) you have not
previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your use of the Service is in
compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an individual representative
of an entity, organization, or company, including those obtaining use of the Service through an
Enterprise License as further described in Section III(3) (Enterprise Accounts) you represent and
warrant that you have authority to bind such entity, organization, or company and those individuals
who will be operating any Accounts to the Agreement and any order forms entered into between you and
us.
</p>
<h3>2.2 Age Restrictions.</h3>
<p class="p2">
People who are 13 or older but under the age of majority where they reside may only use the Service
under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by the Agreement.
Children under 13 are not permitted to use the Service. If you know someone under the age of 13
using the Service, please let us know by emailing
<a href="mailto:support@splice.com"><span class="s2">support@splice.com</span></a
                    >. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has created an Account, please
include any information, such as username, that will aid in identifying the account, to have the
Account closed and personal information deleted.
</p>
<h2>II. The Service</h2>
<h3>1. General.</h3>
<p class="p2">
The Service offers a platform designed to provide you with resources to perform and enhance music
creation and collaboration. The Service is owned and operated by Splice, and the visual interfaces,
graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object
code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Service provided by Splice are
protected by intellectual property and other laws. In addition to the foregoing, all information,
data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other
materials included and made available to you by Splice in the Service are the property of Splice or
its third-party licensors (the “<b>Splice Property</b>”). You may only use Splice Property as
provided herein, and Splice reserves all rights to the Splice Property not granted expressly in
these Terms.
</p>
<h3>2. Your Use of the Service and Splice Property.</h3>
<p class="p2">
Unless otherwise expressly authorized by Splice in writing, including within the Service (e.g., for
versions of Splice Sounds that can be used commercially), we authorize you, subject to these Terms,
to access and use the Service and the Splice Property, at our discretion solely for your own
personal or internal business purposes. Any other use is expressly prohibited.
</p>
<h3>3. Splice Sounds.</h3>
<p class="p2">
Splice engages talented musicians, sound designers, vocalists and producers to create a highly
curated and quality sound library known to our Users as Splice Sounds. Our catalog of materials such
as samples, presets, loops, stems, one-shots, sounds and MIDI patterns or files on the Service,
i.e., materials made available for download through Splice Sounds are collectively referred to
herein as “<b>Sounds</b>” and gives Users access to a fixed number of credits (“<b>Credits</b>”) per
month to redeem for downloads of Sounds. Unless otherwise indicated through the Service, previewing
or auditioning any Sounds, organizing Sounds into your personal collection and saving a Sound to
“Your Sounds” for future use, in each case without downloading a Sound, generally does not require a
Credit. Once you redeem a Credit for a Sound, unless otherwise indicated through the Service, you
may re-download that Sound an unlimited amount of times from Splice Sounds without using additional
Credits as long as your subscription is active.
</p>
</div>
<div class="terms-step privacy-rich-text">
<p class="li2"><b>3.1 License and Ownership Terms for Splice Sounds</b></p>
<p class="p3">
<b>3.1.1 Your Use of Sounds</b>. Sounds are licensed, not sold, to you. Upon your download of a
Sound, you may obtain a copy of the license granted to you for that Sound (a “<b>Certified License</b
                    >”) for purposes of evidencing your download to a third party (e.g. distributors, labels,
audiovisual media companies, etc.) or otherwise. You may obtain a Certified License by accessing the
“Your Sounds” section of your Library, selecting the Sound(s) you wish to generate a Certified
License for, and clicking the “Generate Certified License” option in the menu bar. A Certified
License can be obtained for every Sound. The Certified License describes the terms of the license
granted to you by Splice in these Terms in connection with the use of any Sound in a New Recording
or Creative Work. For purposes of clarity, you may only access your Library and get a Certified
License with an active subscription.
</p>
<div class="inner-term-step">
<p class="p4">
<b>3.1.1.1 New Recordings</b>. Subject your compliance with the Agreement we grant you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual right to use Sounds you obtain through Splice Sounds in
combination with other sounds in music productions to create new recordings (each a “<b>New Recording</b
                      >”). This means that you may modify, reproduce, publicly perform, distribute, transmit,
communicate to the public, sublicense and otherwise use Sounds as embodied in a New Recording,
including for commercial purposes, except as prohibited hereinbelow. You (and/or any applicable
third-party contributors or artists engaged by you in connection with the New Recording) will own
any original contributions made to the New Recording that are not comprised of Sounds (e.g., added
vocals or added instrumentation). For the avoidance of doubt, you will not own the Sounds.
</p>
<p class="p4">
<b>3.1.1.2 Creative Works. </b>Further subject to your compliance with the Agreement, we grant you
a non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual right to use Sounds you obtain through Splice Sounds
for non-commercial and commercial use in creative works other than New Recordings, such as but not
limited to, video games, film or television projects (including synchronization uses), radio, live
performances, and so-called vlogs, used either in isolation as sound effects, loops, and/or sound
mixes (collectively, “<b>Creative Works</b>”). For the avoidance of doubt, non-fungible tokens
(NFTs) are not Creative Works.
</p>
<p class="p4">
<b>3.1.1.3 Prohibited Uses.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary and with respect to both
New Recordings and Creative Works, you may not (a) sublicense the Sounds in isolation as sound
effects, loops, or as source material for any other form of sample (even if you modify the
Sounds), (b) use or sublicense Sounds in a manner competitive to Splice or its licensors, (c)
sublicense, sell, loan, share, lend, broadcast, rent, lease, assign, distribute, or transfer the
Sounds to a third party except as incorporated into a New Recording or Creative Work; (d)
redistribute Sounds in new sample packs; (e) re-record or re-produce the Sounds (e.g., re-record
vocals of a Sound for use in a New Recording or Creative Work, whether or not you spend a Credit);
(f) use any Sounds or portions of Sounds identified as made available for “preview” other than to
internally and locally (on the Service) preview the applicable Sound (and for the avoidance of
doubt, “preview” Sounds may not be modified, reproduced, publicly performed, distributed,
transmitted, communicated to the public, sublicensed, or otherwise used, including for commercial
purposes); (g) use the Sounds without spending Credits unless such Sounds have been designated for
a promotion in which they are offered for no Credits, are part of the use of the Create Tool where
a User does not save, copy, or download their Stack as further described in Section II(3.3)
(Create Tool) or (h) use the Sounds as source or training material for generative or other
artificial intelligence programs. Additionally, you may not use the name, image, or likeness of
any artist associated with a Sound in any way without that artist’s express written permission.
Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, including the photo of an artist associated with
a Sound when promoting your New Recording or Creative Work and/or crediting the artist as a
featured artist on, or other contributor to your New Recording.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<b>3.2 Unoriginal Sounds. </b>We require that all Sounds provided to us by our partners are
original. If we learn that a Sound previously provided to you was not original to the provider, or
we have a good faith reason to believe the Sound is not original, we may remove the Sound from the
Service and may use reasonable efforts to notify you. If you have reason to believe that a Sound
you obtained from Splice Sounds is not original to the provider, please let us know by emailing
copyright@splice.com<b> (See our </b

</p>
</div>
<div class="li2">
<p>
<b>3.3 Create Tool. </b>Splice’s proprietary AI-assisted music creation technology serves
complimentary Sounds from the Splice Sounds catalog allowing users to layer a maximum of 8 Sounds
to create a stack ("<b>Stack</b>”). Users can access this technology via the Splice mobile
application, the Splice desktop app or the Splice website at splice.com (“<b>Create Tool</b>”).
Users are required to register an Account in order to save a Stack. Users must expend their
Credits in accordance with the terms of their Splice Sounds subscription plan in order to copy,
export and/or download a Stack outside of the Create Tool. For the avoidance of doubt, unless
otherwise indicated through the Service, previewing or auditioning any Sounds in the Create Tool
does not require a Credit. All Sounds used in Stacks are licensed, not sold to you. A Stack on its
own is not deemed a New Recording or Creative Work, however, a Stack in combination with other
sounds in music productions may be considered a New Recording or Creative Work. All terms and
conditions set forth in Section II(3) (Splice Sounds) shall be applicable to your use of the
Create Tool and the creation of a Stack.
</p>
</div>
<div class="terms-step">
<p class="p7">
<b> 3.3.1 User Audio</b>. The Create Tool enables Users to incorporate their own audio, either the
User’s original audio or audio that a User has been granted the required rights by a third party
(“<b>User Audio</b>”), as a loop to create a Stack. Users can select a file, which is comprised of
one, two, four or eight bars, from their device or DAW session and upload the User Audio into the
Create Tool. The Create Tool will find compatible sounds to the User Audio, and the combination of
the User Audio and Sound will become a new Stack. The Stack containing User Audio will be
considered a New Recording or Creative Work by the User. Users may save the User Audio Stack in
their Account library or export the User Audio Stack in a supported format, including DAW project,
rendered stereo mix or as a collection of individual audio files. All terms and conditions set
forth in Section II(3) (Splice Sounds) shall be applicable to a User in connection with the use of
the Create Tool and User Audio.
</p>
<p class="p8">
<b>3.3.2 Usage</b>. User Audio will be used by Splice to search the Splice Sounds catalog for
complimentary sounds and for playback of User Audio Stacks by the User. By using the Create Tool
in connection with User Audio, you hereby grant Splice a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual,
irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable right (including any
moral rights) and license to use, license, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform,
and publicly display the User Audio (in whole or in part) solely for the purposes of operating and
providing the Service to you. User Audio files will remain on the Service and be accessible by the
User who originally uploaded the User Audio as long as (a) the User Audio file and/or containing
Stacks are not deleted by the User and (b) the Users subscription remains active. If a User
cancels their subscription or if their subscription is otherwise terminated in accordance with
these Terms, any and all User Audio uploaded by the User will be removed from the User’s saved
Stacks and will be deleted from the Service within thirty (30) days of such cancellation or
termination. A User may remove their uploaded User Audio from the Service at any time by directly
deleting the User Audio file on the Stack detail page or by deleting the full Stack containing the
User Audio. For the avoidance of doubt, Credits will not be expended for the download or export of
User Audio files. User Audio will not (a) be used by Splice as training data for AI or machine
learning models or (b) be accessible to any other User of the Service unless the Stack containing
such User Audio is shared via the Service or exported and shared outside of the Service as a new
audio file. For purposes of clarity, if you are found to have infringed any third party’s rights
with respect to any User Audio, you will have violated these Terms and Splice reserves the right
to terminate your subscription immediately and block you from using the Service in the future.
</p>
<p class="p8">
<b>3.3.3</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if you are using a version
of the Create Tool that does not require you to purchase Credits, the following applies: (a) you
are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable right to create and share your Stack on the
Service solely for non-commercial uses; (b) you hold no rights in or to any Stacks you create or
the Sounds contained therein; (c) you may not use the Stack you create within an audiovisual work
or any other content that is exhibited, distributed and/or hosted on a third-party platform for
purposes of monetization; (d) you may not use the Stack you create in a New Recording and/or
Creative Work; (e) you may not rip, reproduce, reverse engineer, reverse compile, modify, make
derivative works of, or otherwise alter the Stack, any of the Sounds layered in the Stack, or any
of the content added to the Stack by Splice during export of a Stack outside of the Create Tool;
(f) you may not sublicense Stacks as sound effects, loops, or as source material for any other
form of sample (even if you modify the Stack); (g) you may not use or sublicense Stacks in a
manner competitive to Splice or its licensors; (h) you may not sublicense, sell, loan, share,
lend, broadcast, rent, lease, assign, distribute, or transfer Stacks to a third party; (i) you may
not redistribute Stacks except as may be set forth herein; (j) you may not use a Stack as source
or training material for generative or other artificial intelligence programs; and (k) you make
not use User Audio in connection with the creation of a Stack.

<div class="terms-step">
<p class="p3"><b>3.4.1 Fees.</b> Splice Sounds is provided as part of the Service.</p>
<p class="p3">
<b>3.4.2 Promotional Codes. </b>From time to time, in connection with other promotional activities
for Sounds made available on Splice Sounds, we may offer promotional codes (“<b>Codes</b>”) that
can be redeemed as Credits for Sounds. Codes are for personal and non-commercial use only and may
not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner. Only one Code can be used per User in
connection with each promotion. We reserve the right to disable any Code in our sole discretion.
Codes (a) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that we establish for such Code; (b) are
not valid for cash; and (c) may expire prior to your use. We may withhold or deduct Credits or
other features or benefits obtained through the use of Codes by you if we determine or believe
that the use or redemption of a Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the
applicable Code terms or the Agreement.

<h3>5. Splice Plugins.</h3>
<p class="p10">
<span class="s3"></span>Splice’s plugin platform allows Users to obtain software plugins, related
hardware and other gear from Splice and third-party developers (such platform, the
“<b>Marketplace</b>” and such plugins and gear, “<b>Plugins</b>”). If you obtain a Plugin through
the Service, then any problems or support issues must be resolved with the developer of such Plugin,
which may be Splice or a third party, as identified on the Service, unless otherwise set forth on
the Service.

<b>5.1.</b><span class="s4"><b> </b></span
                    ><span class="s5"><b>License Terms for Plugins and Marketplace</b>. Plugins </span>are licensed, not
sold, to you. You may not sell, sublicense or otherwise transfer the serial number or other
identifier of your license to another individual or entity.
</p>
<div class="terms-step">
<p class="p11">
<b>5.1.1 For Splice Plugins.</b> For Plugins developed by Splice (“<b>Splice Plugins</b>”), unless
otherwise set forth in writing by Splice (including on the Marketplace or otherwise on the
Service), the following license terms shall apply: Subject to your compliance with the Agreement,
Splice grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, revocable license, during the term of your
applicable Splice subscription (as further described in Section IX(2)) (Service Subscription
Fees), to perform, display and use those Splice Plugins on any compatible device that you own or
control.
</p>
<p class="p11">
<b>5.1.2 For Third-Party Plugins.</b> Plugins developed by third parties, as identified in the
Marketplace or otherwise on the Service (“<b>Third-Party Plugins</b>”), are not subject to the
license grant set forth above. Rather, use of such Third-Party Plugins will be governed by the
separate license terms provided for such Third-Party Plugins. If no separate license terms
accompany the Third-Party Plugin on the Marketplace or otherwise on the Service, then you are
granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual license to perform, display and use the Plugin on
any compatible device that you own or control, subject to the payment terms set forth below.
</p>
</div>
<p class="p13"><b>5.2. Fees and Billing for Plugins and the Marketplace</b></p>
<div class="terms-step">
<p class="p11">
<b>5.2.1 Fees.</b> Splice Plugins are provided as part of the Service. The cost for Third-Party
Plugins (the “<b>Cost</b>”) will be set forth on the Service with the applicable Third-Party
Plugin. If you opt into a Payment Plan (defined below), then you will pay a certain fraction of
the Cost each month as set forth on the Service (each, an “<b>Installment</b>”) for the number of
months set forth on the Service, until the Cost is fully paid off, as further described below. For
clarity, you may pay off the entire balance of the Cost at any time during your Payment Plan.
</p>
<p class="p11">
<b>5.2.2 Payment Plans.</b> If you obtain a Third-Party Plugin through a rent-to-own payment plan
(“<b>Payment Plan</b>”), then you are purchasing a month-to-month license for the duration of the
Payment Plan, at the end of which (if you have made all of your Installment payments without
refund, chargeback, or other payment issues), your monthly license will be converted to a
perpetual license. If you cancel your Payment Plan or pause your Payment Plan, as set forth below,
you will lose your monthly license to the Third-Party Plugin, and therefore your ability to access
the applicable Third-Party Plugin, unless and until you restart your Payment Plan. You will not
receive a perpetual license to a Third-Party Plugin under a Payment Plan until after you pay the
last Installment of your Payment Plan. If you have a Payment Plan, then Splice will charge your
payment method each month for the Installment until you cancel or pause your Payment Plan. UNLESS
YOU HAVE A FREE TRIAL, YOU MUST PAY FOR AT LEAST ONE INSTALLMENT PRIOR TO USING A THIRD-PARTY
PLUGIN. BY PURCHASING A LICENSE FOR A THIRD-PARTY PLUGIN SUBJECT TO A PAYMENT PLAN, YOU AGREE THAT
SPLICE WILL CHARGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD EACH MONTH FOR THE PRICE OF AN INSTALLMENT UNTIL THE
COMPLETE PRICE IS PAID OFF, UNLESS YOU CANCEL OR PAUSE YOUR PAYMENT PLAN, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED
BELOW. YOU AUTHORIZE SPLICE TO CHARGE THE PAYMENT METHOD THAT OUR SERVICE PROVIDER HAS ON FILE FOR
YOU TO PAY FOR ANY INSTALLMENTS. WE WILL CHARGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD FOR THE INSTALLMENT EACH MONTH
ON THE DAY CORRESPONDING TO THE DATE YOU PURCHASED THE THIRD-PARTY PLUGIN, OR, IF NO SUCH DATE
EXISTS IN A GIVEN MONTH, THEN THE LAST DAY OF SUCH MONTH.
</p>
<p class="p11">
<b>5.2.3 Cancellation.</b> YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR PAYMENT PLAN AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO PAYMENT OF THE
FINAL INSTALLMENT, AFTER WHICH YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO THE THIRD-PARTY PLUGIN OR BE ABLE
TO USE PURCHASED PRESETS IN NEW RECORDINGS AND CREATIVE WORKS. TO CANCEL YOUR PAYMENT PLAN, PLEASE
VISIT THE BILLING SECTION OF YOUR ACCOUNT PAGE. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR PAYMENT PLAN, THEN YOUR
CANCELLATION WILL BE EFFECTIVE AT THE END OF YOUR THEN-CURRENT BILLING CYCLE, SUBJECT TO SECTION
II(5.2.4) (RESUMING PAYMENT PLANS). If we suspect that you are incurring excess or FRAUDULENT
chargebacks to your bank, we reserve the right to cancel your Payment Plan and/or Account in our
sole discretion. FURTHER, SPLICE AND ITS LICENSORS RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CANCEL A USER’S PAYMENT
PLAN WITHOUT PROVIDING A REFUND IF SUCH USER BREACHES THE AGREEMENT.
</p>
<p class="p11">
<b>5.2.4 Resuming Payment Plans.</b> If you cancel your Payment Plan in accordance with these
Terms, then you may be able to restart your Payment Plan in the future. If you restart your
Payment Plan, your account will reflect any Installment payments made by you prior to your
cancellation. Without limiting the foregoing, Splice does not make any guarantee that any
particular Plugin will be available for you to restart a Payment Plan.

purposes permitted within that free trial (e.g., auditioning, liking and organizing samples) during
this Cooling-off Period.

or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” The
foregoing release does not apply to any claims, demands, or any losses, damages, rights and actions
of any kind, including personal injuries, death or property damage for any unconscionable commercial
practice by a Splice Entity or for such party’s fraud, deception, false, promise, misrepresentation

Service, including an App, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty
therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or

<h2>XIV. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement.</h2>
<p class="p2">
Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“<b>Arbitration Agreement</b>”)
carefully. It requires Users to arbitrate disputes with Splice and limits the manner in which you
can seek relief from us.
</p>
<p class="p2">
<b>1. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</b> You and we agree that any dispute, claim, or
request for relief by or against the Splice relating in any way to your access to or use of the
Service or the Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that
(a) you and we may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and
remain in small claims court; and (b) you or Splice may seek equitable relief in court for
infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress,
domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement,
the terms “we”, “us” or “Splice” mean Distributed Creation Inc. and any of its predecessors,
successors, assigns, corporate parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives.
</p>
<p class="p2">
<b>2. Arbitration Rules and Forum.</b> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a
letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to Splice
at the contact address found at the end of these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS,
an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or
requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject
to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at
<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/"><span class="s2">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</span></a
                    >; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive
Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/"><span class="s2">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</span></a
                    >. Any arbitration of a dispute relating to your use of the Service primarily for personal, family
or household purposes shall also be subject to the allocation of arbitration costs and other
requirements of the JAMS’ policy regarding Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses
Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness available at
<a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/"><span class="s2">https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/</span></a
                    >. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is
not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator
finds that you cannot afford to pay any applicable JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or
other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Splice will pay them for you. In addition, Splice
will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes,
claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the
claims are frivolous. If you are a consumer User of our Service residing in California, we waive any
rights to recover our costs or attorney’s fees as a prevailing party in arbitration.
</p>
<p class="p2">
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in
person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the
award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p class="p2">
<b>3. Authority of Arbitrator.</b> The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine
the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to
the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement
including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is
void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Splice.
The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant
any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral
forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue
a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which
the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The
award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
</p>
<p class="p2">
<b>4. Waiver of Jury Trial.</b> YOU AND SPLICE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS
TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Splice are instead electing
that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this
Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section XIV(1) (Applicability of Arbitration
Agreement) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a
court and must follow the Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in
arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
</p>
<p class="p2">
<b>5. Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</b> ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR
RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE
CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a
decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s
limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim for relief and only that claim for
relief shall be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in
the State of New York. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.
</p>
<p class="p2">
<b>6. 30-Day Right to Opt Out.</b> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this
Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: support@splice.com,
within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must
include your name and address, your Splice username (if any), the email address you used to set up
your Splice account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this
Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of the
Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on
any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
</p>
<p class="p2">
<b>7. Severability.</b> Except as provided in Section XIV(5) (Waiver of Class or Other
Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the
law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect
and shall be severed and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect.
</p>
<p class="p2">
<b>8. Survival of Agreement.</b> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
relationship with Splice.
</p>
<p class="p2">
<b>9. Modification.</b> Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, we agree
that if Splice makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that
change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by following the procedure set
forth in Section XIV(6) (30-Day Right to Opt Out) above.

<h2>XVI. Splice DMCA Policy.</h2>
<p class="p2">
<b>1. Notification. </b>The DMCA provides recourse for intellectual property owners who believe that
material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. law. If you believe in good
faith that materials posted on the Service infringe your intellectual property rights, then you (or
your agent) may send us a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be
removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:
</p>
<p class="p2">
(a) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the
works that have been allegedly infringed;
</p>
<p class="p2">
(b) Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple
copyrighted works located on the Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list
of such works);
</p>
<p class="p2">
(c) Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing
activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on the Service;
</p>
<p class="p2">(d) Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);</p>
<p class="p2">
(e) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained
of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
</p>
<p class="p2">
(f) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,
that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.
</p>
<p class="p2">
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against
you, then the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice.
</p>
<p class="p2">
<b>2. Designated Agent. </b>Notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the
DMCA; see
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/"><span class="s2">http://www.loc.gov/copyright/</span></a>
for details. Notices with respect to the Service should be sent to:

<p class="p2"><b>3. False Notifications of Claimed Infringement.</b></p>
<p class="p2">
The Copyright Act provides that “[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section
512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that
material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for
any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any
copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured
by such misrepresentation, as the result of [our] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or
disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed
material or ceasing to disable access to it.” 17 U.S.C. § 512(f). Accordingly, we reserve the right
to seek damages from any party that submits a notification of claimed infringement or counter
notification in violation of the law.
</p>
<p class="p2">
Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. § 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there
are penalties for false claims under the DMCA. The foregoing is not intended to provide you with
legal advice.
