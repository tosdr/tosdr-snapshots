      Service, i.e., materials made available for download through Splice Sounds
      are collectively referred to herein as “<strong>Sounds</strong>” and gives
      Users access to a fixed number of credits (“<strong>Credits</strong>”) per
      month to redeem for downloads of Sounds. Unless otherwise indicated
      through the Service, previewing or auditioning any Sounds, organizing
      Sounds into your personal collection and saving a Sound to “Your Sounds”
      for future use, in each case without downloading a Sound, generally does
      not require a Credit. Once you redeem a Credit for a Sound, unless
      otherwise indicated through the Service, you may re-download that Sound an
      unlimited amount of times from Splice Sounds without using additional
      Credits as long as long as you have an Account.</p> <ol class="svelte-i3tk9z"><li class="svelte-i3tk9z" data-svelte-h="svelte-1742fx0"><strong>3.1 License and Ownership Terms for Splice Sounds</strong> <ol class="svelte-i3tk9z"><li class="svelte-i3tk9z"><strong>3.1.1 Your Use of Sounds</strong>. Sounds are licensed, not
            sold, to you. Upon your download of a Sound, you may obtain a copy
            of the license granted to you for that Sound (a “<strong>Certified License</strong>”) for purposes of evidencing your download to a third party (e.g.
            distributors, labels, audiovisual media companies, etc.) or
            otherwise. You may obtain a Certified License by accessing the “Your
            Sounds” section of your Library, selecting the Sound(s) you wish to
            generate a Certified License for, and clicking the “Generate
            Certified License” option in the menu bar. A Certified License can
            be obtained for every Sound. The Certified License describes the
            terms of the license granted to you by Splice in these Terms in
            connection with the use of any Sound in a New Recording or Creative
            Work. For purposes of clarity, you may access your Library so long

        Splice’s proprietary AI-assisted music creation technology serves
        complimentary Sounds from the Splice Sounds catalog allowing users to
        layer a maximum of 8 Sounds to create a stack (&quot;<strong>Stack</strong>”). Users can access this technology via the Splice mobile application,
        the Splice desktop app or the Splice website at splice.com (“<strong>Create Tool</strong>”). Users are required to register an Account in order to save a Stack.
        Users must expend their Credits in accordance with the terms of their
        Splice Sounds subscription plan in order to copy, export and/or download
        a Stack outside of the Create Tool. For the avoidance of doubt, unless
        otherwise indicated through the Service, previewing or auditioning any
        Sounds in the Create Tool does not require a Credit. All Sounds used in
        Stacks are licensed, not sold to you. A Stack on its own is not deemed a
        New Recording or Creative Work, however, a Stack in combination with
        other sounds in music productions may be considered a New Recording or
        Creative Work. All terms and conditions set forth in Section II(3)
        (Splice Sounds) shall be applicable to your use of the Create Tool and
        the creation of a Stack.
        <ol class="svelte-i3tk9z"><li class="svelte-i3tk9z"><strong>3.3.1 User Audio</strong>. The Create Tool enables Users to
            incorporate their own audio, either the User’s original audio or
            audio that a User has been granted the required rights by a third
            party (“<strong>User Audio</strong>”), as a loop to create a Stack.
            Users can select a file, which is comprised of one, two, four or
            eight bars, from their device or DAW session and upload the User
            Audio into the Create Tool. The Create Tool will find compatible
            sounds to the User Audio, and the combination of the User Audio and
            Sound will become a new Stack. The Stack containing User Audio will
            be considered a New Recording or Creative Work by the User. Users
            may save the User Audio Stack in their Account library or export the
            User Audio Stack in a supported format, including DAW project,
            rendered stereo mix or as a collection of individual audio files.
            All terms and conditions set forth in Section II(3) (Splice Sounds)
            shall be applicable to a User in connection with the use of the
            Create Tool and User Audio.</li> <li class="svelte-i3tk9z"><strong>3.3.2 Usage</strong>
            User Audio will be used by Splice to search the Splice Sounds catalog
            for complimentary sounds and for playback of User Audio Stacks by the
            User. By using the Create Tool in connection with User Audio, you hereby
            grant Splice a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide,
            royalty-free, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable right (including
            any moral rights) and license to use, license, distribute, reproduce,
            modify, adapt, publicly perform, and publicly display the User Audio
            (in whole or in part) solely for the purposes of operating and providing
            the Service to you. User Audio files will remain on the Service and be
            accessible by the User who originally uploaded the User Audio as long
            as (a) the User Audio file and/or containing Stacks are not deleted by
            the User and (b) the Users subscription remains active. If a User cancels
            their subscription or if their subscription is otherwise terminated in
            accordance with these Terms, any and all User Audio uploaded by the User
            will be removed from the User’s saved Stacks and will be deleted from
            the Service within thirty (30) days of such cancellation or termination.
            A User may remove their uploaded User Audio from the Service at any time
            by directly deleting the User Audio file on the Stack detail page or
            by deleting the full Stack containing the User Audio. For the avoidance
            of doubt, Credits will not be expended for the download or export of
            User Audio files. User Audio will not (a) be used by Splice as training
            data for AI or machine learning models or (b) be accessible to any other
            User of the Service unless the Stack containing such User Audio is shared
            via the Service or exported and shared outside of the Service as a new
            audio file. For purposes of clarity, if you are found to have infringed
            any third party’s rights with respect to any User Audio, you will have
            violated these Terms and Splice reserves the right to terminate your
            subscription immediately and block you from using the Service in the

                Plugin, unless and until you restart your Payment Plan. You will

                TRIAL, YOU MUST PAY FOR AT LEAST ONE INSTALLMENT PRIOR TO USING
                A THIRD-PARTY PLUGIN. BY PURCHASING A LICENSE FOR A THIRD-PARTY

      Section XIII (Third-Party Services) with a valid credit card or debit card
      number (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us), or allow

      you in connection with the Agreement, Splice shall collect such Sales Tax
      in addition to the payments required under Section IX(2) (Service
      Subscription Fees) of these Terms. If any services, or payments for any

      jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Splice,
      you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related
      penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will
      indemnify Splice for any liability or expense Splice may incur in
      connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon Splice’s request, you will provide
      it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or
      other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes
      of this Section, “<strong>Sales Tax</strong>” shall mean any sales or use
      tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</h2> <p class="svelte-i3tk9z">Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”) carefully.

      against the Splice relating in any way to your access to or use of the
      Service or the Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather
      than in court, except that (a) you and we may assert claims or seek relief
      in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims
      court; and (b) you or Splice may seek equitable relief in court for
      infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as
      trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and
      patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, the terms “we”, “us”
      or “Splice” mean Distributed Creation Inc. and any of its predecessors,
      successors, assigns, corporate parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and
      each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
      representatives.</p> <p class="svelte-i3tk9z"><strong>2. Arbitration Rules and Forum.</strong> The Federal
      Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
      Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a
      letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or
      request for relief to Splice at the contact address found at the end of
      these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established
      alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims,
      counterclaims, or requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of
      attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current
      version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available
      at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/

      of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/

      primarily for personal, family or household purposes shall also be subject
      to the allocation of arbitration costs and other requirements of the JAMS’
      policy regarding Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses
      Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/">https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/
      </a>. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling
      JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties
      will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that
      you cannot afford to pay any applicable JAMS’s filing, administrative,
      hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Splice
      will pay them for you. In addition, Splice will reimburse all such JAMS’s
      filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or
      requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator
      determines the claims are frivolous. If you are a consumer User of our
      Service residing in California, we waive any rights to recover our costs
      or attorney’s fees as a prevailing party in arbitration.</p> <p class="svelte-i3tk9z">You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
      written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at
      another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by
      the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p> <h3 class="svelte-i3tk9z">3. Authority of Arbitrator.</h3> <p class="svelte-i3tk9z">The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope

      formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any
      assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or
      voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any,
      of you and Splice. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated
      with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
      arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
      part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
      monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available
      to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the
      Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall
      issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
      findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the
      calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority
      to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law
      would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and
      us.</p> <h3 class="svelte-i3tk9z">4. Waiver of Jury Trial.</h3> <p class="svelte-i3tk9z">YOU AND SPLICE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE

      as specified in Section XIV(1) (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement)
      above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and
      relief as a court and must follow the Agreement as a court would. However,
      there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
      arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p> <h3 class="svelte-i3tk9z">5. Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</h3> <p class="svelte-i3tk9z"> ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF
      THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
      NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE,
      AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
      CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is
      issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this
      subsection’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that
      claim for relief and only that claim for relief shall be severed from the
      arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the
      State of New York. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief
      shall be arbitrated.</p> <h3 class="svelte-i3tk9z">6. 30-Day Right to Opt Out.</h3> <p class="svelte-i3tk9z">You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration
      Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to:
      <a href="mailto:support@splice.com">support@splice.com</a>, within thirty
      (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your

      the email address you used to set up your Splice account (if you have
      one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this
      Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all
      other parts of the Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of
      this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration
      agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with
      us.</p> <h3 class="svelte-i3tk9z">7. Severability.</h3> <p class="svelte-i3tk9z">Except as provided in Section XIV(5) (Waiver of Class or Other
      Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration
      Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then
      such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be
      severed and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue in
      full force and effect.</p> <h3 class="svelte-i3tk9z">8. Survival of Agreement.</h3> <p class="svelte-i3tk9z">This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
      relationship with Splice.</p> <h3 class="svelte-i3tk9z">9. Modification.</h3> <p class="svelte-i3tk9z">Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, we agree
      that if Splice makes any future material change to this Arbitration
      Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such
      change becoming effective by following the procedure set forth in Section
      XIV(6) (30-Day Right to Opt Out) above.</p></section> <section data-svelte-h="svelte-ig7rue"><h2 class="svelte-i3tk9z">XV. General Provisions</h2> <h3 class="svelte-i3tk9z">1.
