If you do not agree with these Terms, do not register or use any of the Services.</p><p>By using, accessing or browsing the Box Service, platform and products including applications, mobile, software, websites or other properties owned or operated by Box or by registering for a Box account ( "<strong>Services</strong>") you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms for the Services provided by Box ("<strong>Box</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>"). If you reside in the United States, you are entering into this contract with Box, Inc. If you reside outside of the United States excluding Japan, you are entering into this contract with Box.com (UK) Ltd., a company registered in England and Wales (company number 0809736), VAT number GB177912768. If you reside in Japan, you are entering into this contract with K.K.

Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these Terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms. You may also receive supplemental terms which apply specifically to you and amend these Terms as well as any subsequently published version of these Terms.

By using Box Sign to send files for signature without changing the default disclosure settings, you are adopting this disclosure each time as terms that will govern your Box Sign transaction. Similarly if you customize the disclosure in your administrative console, the customized terms you create will be presented to each recipient of your Box Sign requests and will govern each of your Box Sign transactions.</p><p>Only you may use your Box account and you are responsible for all aspects of your account.&nbsp;Each user must have a separate account.
