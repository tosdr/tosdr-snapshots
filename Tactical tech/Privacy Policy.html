How important polarization is, how important the lack of trust towards specific formats of communication are, or how institutions fail, because in this environment it is much easier to put forward everything from conspiracy theories to fake information, but it also makes people frustrated. It makes people to be much more black and white and aligning themselves with things that they would not align with earlier. I think this is the major thing that we are focusing on this year.

I have seen the promises of technology liberating this and that, I have seen the fears of technology taking away this and that. We have seen a lot in the last 30-plus years, since we all got hooked on the internet, since the speed of data processing and storage became the norm, and our muscles started to twitch to phantom vibrations, and swiping became the gesture of the last decade.

All the other stacks, layers that we've built on top of that since the first electromechanical programmable and binary computer, the Z1, built around 1937 by\nKonrad Zuse (it doesn't really matter who started it, but somehow it's interesting who will finish it), give us a strange sense of great variety - when there isn't much of it. This also has to do with how reduced it is from a political point of view - everything we compute has to be calculable - has to be translated into what computers can process. Computers, and the technology that uses them, push us to apply this particular way of thinking to everything imaginable and everything that exists.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eA car is a computer, a phone is a computer, so your online relationship with another person (?) is a computer, and so is your vote in an election, if you live in a place where they still have them, free and democratic elections.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThe second acceleration is more clearly devastating - and that is that environmental and climate change has become daily horror news, there aren't many people out there who don't agree, the more you look at the data the less convincing you need. Yes there is still plenty of denial but it seems to be moving towards doubting the causes rather than the status quo. And this acceleration is closely linked to conflict, extinction of various life forms (animals, forests, habitats), migration and access to food or clean air, to name just the beginning of the long list.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eUnderstanding the real scale and scope and consequences of the environmental crisis depends on how digital technology influences our thinking about it in terms of scale and depth and short and long term consequences, as well as what solutions we can imagine to create and deploy against all this chaos. If technology is the answer,  what matters is who runs all the technical infrastructure, who collects all the data, who has the capacity, who can apply sophisticated methods of analysis, and what they are prepared to do with all the conclusions they might draw, backed up by the unlimited power of the data centres at their disposal.

The above is a graphic explanation from the Everything Will Be Fine exhibition of how data companies profile people from their personal data in order to anticipate how they might react to different issues and therefore different crises. Most of us have no idea that this kind of business is creeping beneath our clicks, and that our supposed opinions are being persistently manipulated online. One of the things these companies are exploiting is growing polarisation. I look at certain behaviours online, especially those that get instant stratospheric amplification, that play and win the attention game - I look at them and I can't stop thinking - look what the computer made them do.

Paradoxically, what was once conceived as a tool to produce reliable results based on unreliable technology (which was the idea of the first computer envisioned by von Neumann and Morgenstern in their 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour) has been comically reversed. It feels like we have come full circle, while the components of our computers are becoming incredibly reliable they seem to producing less and less reliable results.

What I can see through my little pinhole is, frankly, naked anger, and anger is a powerful force. Sometimes a force that makes us move beyond our comfort zones, stand up to injustice, engage with ideas we find overwhelming and difficult. Yet, anger is also a brutal force, a blinding force that makes us do ugly things. There is a fine line between these two kinds of anger. One we should try to manage, the other we should recognise and use (and we struggle to see which is which, and digital tools are bad at helping).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eI see a lot of anger directed at those in power, or conversely at those who would challenge those in power (depending on who is shouting through a digital megaphone and using and manufacturing trolls), or at people who are not like us, who might threaten our traditions. I see anger at people who don't share our beliefs, values, ideas, whatever.

Now it seems that the planning of the trip is the other way round, apparently we have to have some technology because we have to, because that is what the market says, or some random billionaires broadcast to millions of their followers, or it has been suggested by very well trained algorithms. This time I am not just using the word technology reduced to digital technology, but opening it up to a broader interpretation of what technology actually is (from language to agriculture to a silicon chip glowing next to your bed).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSome people say that we have to change everything. It might sound strange, like how is that really possible? Although I have seen it before - when one political normativity collapses and is replaced by another (I am old enough to have seen the collapse of the Cold War), it was not replaced by something coherent and better. Nor was it done by a single person, or a single act. It was the result of the accumulation of thousands of actions, expressions, sacrifices and perseverances. So, at some point, one thing ran out and the possibilities opened up.\u003c/Text\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThe opening was there.

I also feel like it is not about another but better social media – we need definitely something more interesting then free and open source, federated and encrypted version of Meta. Maybe instead of inventing technological solutions we should in parallel simply reinvest and reimagine our social structures. I know from my political past – never underestimate how important self education is, how important inspiration is, how important it is to work with anyone and everyone who works with knowledge – that being libraries, community centres, informal groups, collectives, art spaces and determined individuals.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cSingleImage format=\"small\" src=\"/website2023/Insights/Insights7.png\" alt=\"Selfportrait interrupted\" caption=\"Selfportrait interrupted, 2023\"\u003e\u003c/SingleImage\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSo, in conclusion, we have looked, in a rather disorganised way, at how technology defines, determines and shapes the way we perceive our role in the world under crisis and its limitations. We looked at some examples of how it can be used as a tool of hope - making us work to prepare for the unexpected, to fix the fixable, to make escape plans, and how we would agree which roads to take to get to a better future than the one we see being predicted. We looked at examples of how technology makes us feel that we are in control as long as we act collectively, and how technology actually makes things very complicated, how we get sucked into confusion and information disorder.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAt Tactical Tech, with our expertise in technology and society as well as our practical experience in connecting this to peoples politics, in our next phase of work we will be addressing the confluence of two major problems. As society comes to terms with the digital, it must reimagine how to live with planetary boundaries and enable a just transition. We need to do more together, across borders, experiences and expertise, the discussions we need to have about technology need to be inclusive and diverse, and they need to be relatable yet forward looking.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eOur room for manoeuvre, caught between the scale and gravity of the problems we need to solve and the inadequacy of the tools we have at our disposal, requires us to rethink the methods and strategies we can produce in the limited time we have at our disposal. Particularly in the sphere of influence, we are suffering from a massive polarisation of opinions, confusion and a growing state of information disorder. We are seeing that the battle is not about how we gather evidence or analyse the data (although that is still a big problem as long as it remains proprietary), but rather how we build compelling narratives about what needs to be done and how we can influence the discussion and get on board those who make decisions. At Tactical Tech we work with experts, professionals and practitioners like journalists, NGOs and technologists who can frame the narrative and explore what solutions we should be promoting and investing in. Our role is to work practically to advance techniques and counter the impact of the opinion and influence apparatus that is so negatively present in how we engage with, understand and act on climate and environmental degradation.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn parallel, we need more public engagement with the problem of understanding the double acceleration of the digital and the environmental, and the connection between the two. Until communities have the space to find their own ways through the questions that these changes bring and in their own contexts, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for them to make the right choices. This is why Tactical Tech relies heavily on working with anchor organisations, institutions that are embedded in their communities, either in their role as knowledge brokers (libraries, schools, cultural and community centres) or as representatives\nof local and grassroots knowledge, who are trusted and know the context of their\ncommunities' needs and aspirations better than anyone else.

Keeping students at the center while designing learning interventions and programs, rather than tools or teachers, is an effective methodology that is likely to result in personalized experiences for the learners.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eObservations around formal and informal learning can be helpful in order to understand young students’ independence when using digital technologies (2). Marcia Conner’s models (3) can help explain the difference between formal and informal learning, as well as the various learning opportunities that could arise in different groups and spaces. In the first diagram, Conner illustrates how learning can be formal or informal, intentional or unexpected, and how these types of learning can interact with one another.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cSingleImage format=\"small\" src=\"MLCE/researcher_report/mlc-infgb09.jpeg\" caption=\"Diagram from “Introduction to Informal Learning” by Marcia L.

In both spaces, learning can happen intentionally or in unexpected ways. Some experts talk about ‘invisible curricula’ and how students can experience learning that is not part of the main educational plan(4) or even about ‘serendipity learning’(5) in which certain learning experiences come as a ‘happy accident’ of sorts.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAnother of Conner’s models points to non-formal spaces, which could be seen as halfway between the formal and the informal experience. \u003cb\u003eNon-formal experiences\u003c/b\u003e can be structured and have a clear objective but they don’t tend to belong to institutional curricula. Oftentimes, these experiences take place within different kinds of communities and in collaboration with various groups.

It is not easily measurable and it tends to happen while another experience is taking place. Some authors call it \"unintentional\" and others link it to \"invisible learning\" or even \"incidental learning\", because it happens in conjunction with the circumstances surrounding the experience. It is not in the program, or the title, but people still 'leave with it'. For example, at school, students learn how to socialize, how to read hidden tones, and how to treat their peers. Another nice example comes when watching series and movies, language and cultural learning can happen there, even though the person watching is not actually setting out to learn any of those things. Non-intentional learning happens when the individual is not coming with the intention of acquiring any new skill or with a conscious intention to learn.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eMany researchers in education sciences agree that both informal and non-intentional experiences are key, with many of them arguing that most of the knowledge we actually acquire comes from experiences in informal atmospheres(6).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eWe can take these ideas into account and cross them with observations from DML experiences and assessments made by institutions like Nominet and their 2022 Digital Youth Index(7), which highlights how young people have strong self study skills—that is, the capacity to teach oneself—and a tendency to learn through a combination of formal experiences (in school, with their teachers) with informal ones (at home, with peers).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eOther studies and experiences shared and commented on by researchers and practitioners José Luis Mendoza(8) and Adrián Carrera Ahumada(9) revealed the importance of considering the non-formal and the informal, highlighting that the most successful learning experiences in their work happened when “[learners] didn’t notice”(10)—that is, in an informal, non-intentional, or unexpected way.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSome of these practitioners made learning spaces out of their social media pages and started sharing key tools and insights about DML with their followers.

At the same time, researchers like Linn Friedrichs, for example, stress the importance of observing how young people can use social media to engage with and promote causes that are important to them, as well as build meaningful connections online with communities that share their values(12).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn parallel, it would be useful to analyze these experiences and ideas in combination with approaches coming from critical literacy while taking into account the ways some learners around the world are bound to develop some of these skills in tense digital environments marked by censorship or authoritarianism, where actors need to constantly respond to various limitations(13).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eCrossing these ideas together points at the importance of taking into account informal and non-intentional learning experiences.

For example, a program could combine lessons in the classroom with individual study time at the library, as well as diverse assignments students can do in groups or alone. Another example could be a collaboration between a school and an organization that integrates non-formal programs (a data privacy or digital security training) into a wider DML program taking place as part of the formal school curriculum. The idea is to combine and integrate activities inside and outside the school, online and off, as a way to ‘capitalize’ on students’ learning capacity in autonomy while being guided by educators.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cHeadingWithText background=\"white\" heading='Notes on the research question: from “what works?” to “what did they learn?”'\u003e\u003c/HeadingWithText\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAs highlighted before, evaluating results and identifying effective methods in the realm of digital literacy, as with many other educational experiences, can be quite challenging.

These labels do not seem to be helpful in understanding how young people and adults learn, nor how they can learn from each other(20). Teachers and students both bring unique experiences to the table, and it is essential to recognize the value of each perspective. While young people tend to be more comfortable with digital environments and devices, they may lack critical thinking skills when it comes to the content they encounter online. In contrast, some teachers may struggle with digital tools but have a mature and critical perspective on the information they find online. At the same time, with the passing of time, there will be fewer people in the workplace that have known a time before heavily digitalized environments and the main intergenerational difference may arise in terms of the kind of digital tools they’re familiar with, not with whether or not they are digitally literate.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIt is, however, of crucial importance to take teachers’ and practitioners’ experiences in DML to be able to work on robust learning programs for younger participants that can be well adapted and sustainable in time. Such an exploration needs to also take into account learning resources for teachers and educators, as well as training spaces and strategies for these groups. It is not about having teachers that “know it all” in terms of technology, but rather it is key that they are open to learn and evolve in a universe of change.

Some of the most important challenges are related not to technology itself, but to the recognition of students’ and teachers’ learning abilities, lack of access, and the need to surpass certain misconceptions about learning and evaluation (like the fact that the only valuable learning experiences happen inside of the school or that learning can only be measured through quantitative methods). Most of the skills educators are aiming for—reading media critically, being able to write and read comprehensively, and develop a certain independence when interacting with different digital environments—remain similar to those of the past and continue to be necessary to be able to take advantage of the new powerful tools we see rising today.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDML benefits from “patchwork blankets” and alliances\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eWhen developing DML programs, it is important to remember that digital literacy is not a singular concept but instead encompasses various other important literacies and skills.

That way, the focus of the program can be more adaptable to current contexts. We could think of a model that works as a “patchwork blanket” combining autonomous strategies (like work at the library, research on a particular subject, or content creation) with activities in class, as well as various school subjects, allowing it to become a collaboration with different teachers.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThese initiatives can also be supported by the creation of spaces online and offline with a focus on certain areas (as tends to be the case with digital security communities); or even the reconditioning of libraries or community centers that can enhance independent learning while still counting on support and guidance from educators.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAnnotated bibliography\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003cb\u003eGuidelines and resources\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\n\u003cText\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUNESCO.\u003ca href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377068\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eMedia and information literate citizens: think critically, click wisely!\u003c/i\u003eUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2021.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eA robust compilation of theoretical approaches that includes curriculum samples as resources to be used by educators and practitioners.

The research highlights three pillars to build online classes that keep students feeling motivated and playing an active role in their own learning processes. These pillars are: 1) the importance of student participation, 2) the need to design for social interactivity, and 3) apply a user-centered approach (which involves personalizing materials and content).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMoravec, J., Cobo, C., \u003ca href=\"https://www2.educationfutures.com/books/aprendizajeinvisible/en/\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eInvisible learning: toward a new ecology of education\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

One of the main premises of the book is the construction of a polyphonic dialogue between entertainment narratives and formal education content to promote learning. In this way, students' cultural interests can be integrated into didactic sequences of different subjects or even in civic education actions.

In this sense, resources that include games and cater to individual and group participation are key.

The MLCE should also address how technology is impacting young people’s notion of trust— examining what role AI and social media play in influence, trust and the blurring of the lines between their online and offline lives.

In this piece for \u003ca href=\"https://theglassroom.org/\"\u003eThe Glass Room\u003c/a\u003e, we looked at the various applications related to sexual and reproductive health data. Sexual Rights and Reproductive Rights are important for women and non-binary persons. These are central to our existence and are part of a battle we continue fighting every day. But unfortunately, when it comes to providing usable, safe and secure technology platforms for people to monitor or manage their health or live their lives to the fullest, there is little to no work done here. There is much work done around menstruation apps, and we acknowledge that. But, for those who identify as women and non-binary persons, menstruation is only one of the many variables that are relevant to us. There is more to our lives than just periods. So we examined what little platforms were there in the market to support our needs and looked at how they placed us at risk. At the time of this work, and even now, we don’t see many safe and secure platforms talking about these needs. Hence, we built this piece to be futuristic and focused on ways to look at problematic patterns.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cVideo src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/videos/Bachchao Project1_video_the_many_hands_on_your_intimate_data (Original).mp4\" caption=\"Animation created with the support of SIDA.

When we hosted the first The Glass Room in 2019, several conversations with participants made me realise that it’s super important to include work that is relevant to India for participants to relate, this led to a longer conversation between me and the Tactical Tech team on how the exhibitions we build can be more relevant. It took us four years to finally build a program to engage artists and researchers for India-specific art pieces. It started with building a poster as part of The Glass Room collection. Then, we built online events which used The Glass Room posters to host a relevant conversation for India. The journey had a lot of learning lessons for us and is still ongoing. Data: Public, Private and Beyond looked at the usage and collection of public and private data in India and what it means for a person’s autonomy, privacy and security. It was very inspired by the Glass Room. But we wanted to have a wider variety of artwork, not necessarily posters. We were very interested in building art that could be taken in a travel bag to be showcased in different parts of India and the world. We invited pitches from artists and researchers with this brief.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cSingleImage format=\"small\" src=\"website2023/impact_stories/Bachchao Project5.png\" alt=\"Poster of the event Data: Public, Private and Beyond.

But the issues need multidisciplinary approaches. Some solutions can be devised for digital rights issues from platforms and policies, but there are also solutions through informed adoption by users. The use of all of these approaches is necessary for building safer and more inclusive platforms. In India, we see a disconnect between those who build platforms and those who use them. The platforms are either built by people outside of India or by people who don’t do enough research on their usage. Also, informed usage of platforms and advocating for rights is only done by a few users.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThere are considerable barriers to having the privilege of spending time to understand technology platforms and having knowledge of evaluation for oneself, especially in the parameter of privacy, safety and security. It's only fair that the information about rights and suitable platforms is in formats everyone easily understands. This is where artists and creators can provide alternative approaches to communication. Knowledge needs to be passed not only in long-worded essays, but it needs to be passed in as many ways as humans interact with their surroundings, eg. In tactile forms and audio-visual formats.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSo, it is definitely something that other organisations /communities can replicate.

The definition of DML itself and many other surrounding concepts continue to evolve and be debated, but what is certain is that it involves the ability to comprehend, evaluate, and create content through digital tools and platforms, including mobile devices and social media.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eDML expands on the skills that form the foundation of traditional literacy, while also sharing many defining principles with other fields. Part of what makes it an exciting field is that it is wide enough to include other topics, while also being a subject in and of itself. In other words, many of the learning subjects and spaces of today are called upon to find and connect to DML elements, both as a means to an end, and as an end as well.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThis report is based on an exploration of resources and experiences aimed at supporting the Media Literacy Case for Educators (MLCE) project. The goal of the MLCE is to develop a set of learning materials for adolescents (13 to 19 year-olds) with additional supporting resources for both formal and informal educators with varying degrees of confidence in implementing the materials in their classrooms, community centers, institutes, and libraries.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn addition to this report, an annotated bibliography was produced. The bibliography collects and analyzes tools coming from academic research, institutional publications, community projects, and other sources facilitated by researchers and practitioners, all surrounding experiences in DML. Although most of the reviewed research centers on this population, research work taking other ages into account as studies tackling DML in schools—even if they were not specific to the ages that are at the center of the project in process—were included.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eGiven the nature of the field and how dynamic and diverse DML experiences tend to be, brief sections explore ideas around learning, both formal and informal. These conceptual explorations go beyond the age limits of the project, but we thought it important to include them, given their important connection to learning phenomena and the ways they tend to occur regardless of age. Relevant observations coming from conversations with researchers and practitioners via email, as well as discussions that took place during online international convenings, have also been incorporated.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAssessing DML can be challenging due to the lack of consensus on measurable dimensions and the continually evolving nature of technology.

The result of the second phase can be seen in the annotated bibliography included in this report. The collection process paid special attention to experiences that put learners at the center of the experience, rather than a piece of equipment or software. Attention was also given to case studies and research articles that tackled problems related to lack of resources and access, and that also took into consideration a variety of environments (beyond schools) to help young people learn independently.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch3\u003eNotes on learning: conversations with researchers and practitioners\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn the world of DML, there are many avenues for learning. It is fair to say that, just as DML itself, learning is also complex and difficult to assess. However, a brief exploration of the ideas shared to date by researchers and practitioners can be a great deal of help in designing resources and learning experiences. In particular, these ideas can help educators look beyond technology and steer clear of outdated or less effective teaching and learning models. Keeping students at the center while designing learning interventions and programs, rather than tools or teachers, is an effective methodology that is likely to result in personalized experiences for the learners.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eObservations around formal and informal learning can be helpful in order to understand young students’ independence when using digital technologies (2). Marcia Conner’s models (3) can help explain the difference between formal and informal learning, as well as the various learning opportunities that could arise in different groups and spaces. In the first diagram, Conner illustrates how learning can be formal or informal, intentional or unexpected, and how these types of learning can interact with one another.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cSingleImage format=\"small\" src=\"MLCE/researcher_report/mlc-infgb09.jpeg\" caption=\"Diagram from “Introduction to Informal Learning” by Marcia L.

In both spaces, learning can happen intentionally or in unexpected ways. Some experts talk about ‘invisible curricula’ and how students can experience learning that is not part of the main educational plan(4) or even about ‘serendipity learning’(5) in which certain learning experiences come as a ‘happy accident’ of sorts.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAnother of Conner’s models points to non-formal spaces, which could be seen as halfway between the formal and the informal experience. \u003cb\u003eNon-formal experiences\u003c/b\u003e can be structured and have a clear objective but they don’t tend to belong to institutional curricula. Oftentimes, these experiences take place within different kinds of communities and in collaboration with various groups. Digital security trainings, which tend to be fairly common within the digital rights community, could be an illustrative example of this kind of learning environment.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cSingleImage format=\"small\" src=\"MLCE/researcher_report/informallearning-wc-mconner9713.gif\" caption=\"Diagram from “Introduction to Informal Learning” by Marcia L.

It is not easily measurable and it tends to happen while another experience is taking place. Some authors call it \"unintentional\" and others link it to \"invisible learning\" or even \"incidental learning\", because it happens in conjunction with the circumstances surrounding the experience. It is not in the program, or the title, but people still 'leave with it'. For example, at school, students learn how to socialize, how to read hidden tones, and how to treat their peers. Another nice example comes when watching series and movies, language and cultural learning can happen there, even though the person watching is not actually setting out to learn any of those things. Non-intentional learning happens when the individual is not coming with the intention of acquiring any new skill or with a conscious intention to learn.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eMany researchers in education sciences agree that both informal and non-intentional experiences are key, with many of them arguing that most of the knowledge we actually acquire comes from experiences in informal atmospheres(6).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eWe can take these ideas into account and cross them with observations from DML experiences and assessments made by institutions like Nominet and their 2022 Digital Youth Index(7), which highlights how young people have strong self study skills—that is, the capacity to teach oneself—and a tendency to learn through a combination of formal experiences (in school, with their teachers) with informal ones (at home, with peers).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eOther studies and experiences shared and commented on by researchers and practitioners José Luis Mendoza(8) and Adrián Carrera Ahumada(9) revealed the importance of considering the non-formal and the informal, highlighting that the most successful learning experiences in their work happened when “[learners] didn’t notice”(10)—that is, in an informal, non-intentional, or unexpected way.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSome of these practitioners made learning spaces out of their social media pages and started sharing key tools and insights about DML with their followers.

At the same time, researchers like Linn Friedrichs, for example, stress the importance of observing how young people can use social media to engage with and promote causes that are important to them, as well as build meaningful connections online with communities that share their values(12).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn parallel, it would be useful to analyze these experiences and ideas in combination with approaches coming from critical literacy while taking into account the ways some learners around the world are bound to develop some of these skills in tense digital environments marked by censorship or authoritarianism, where actors need to constantly respond to various limitations(13).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eCrossing these ideas together points at the importance of taking into account informal and non-intentional learning experiences.

For example, a program could combine lessons in the classroom with individual study time at the library, as well as diverse assignments students can do in groups or alone. Another example could be a collaboration between a school and an organization that integrates non-formal programs (a data privacy or digital security training) into a wider DML program taking place as part of the formal school curriculum. The idea is to combine and integrate activities inside and outside the school, online and off, as a way to ‘capitalize’ on students’ learning capacity in autonomy while being guided by educators.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cHeadingWithText background=\"white\" heading='Notes on the research question: from “what works?” to “what did they learn?”'\u003e\u003c/HeadingWithText\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAs highlighted before, evaluating results and identifying effective methods in the realm of digital literacy, as with many other educational experiences, can be quite challenging.

The elements that constitute DML are incredibly broad and continually expanding. Many times, the discussions revolve around the focus of the learning experiences (which tools to include, find solutions to access problems) and their environments (at school, with teachers, in autonomy). In parallel, some experts view DML as a fundamental aspect of exercising citizenship, while others see it as a resource that equips students with valuable skills for their future employment, aligning with the demands of the job market.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eTaking this into account, as well as the many references and ideas explored and presented thus far, the following lines aim to serve as recommendations for Tactical Tech and their collaborators as they embark on a co-created project aimed at young students in formal learning environments (that could combine experiences in non formal and informal spaces).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTeachers and educators’ DML skills are key in the development of the process\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAt the beginning of this exploration, intergenerational learning was an area of interest.

These labels do not seem to be helpful in understanding how young people and adults learn, nor how they can learn from each other(20). Teachers and students both bring unique experiences to the table, and it is essential to recognize the value of each perspective. While young people tend to be more comfortable with digital environments and devices, they may lack critical thinking skills when it comes to the content they encounter online. In contrast, some teachers may struggle with digital tools but have a mature and critical perspective on the information they find online. At the same time, with the passing of time, there will be fewer people in the workplace that have known a time before heavily digitalized environments and the main intergenerational difference may arise in terms of the kind of digital tools they’re familiar with, not with whether or not they are digitally literate.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIt is, however, of crucial importance to take teachers’ and practitioners’ experiences in DML to be able to work on robust learning programs for younger participants that can be well adapted and sustainable in time. Such an exploration needs to also take into account learning resources for teachers and educators, as well as training spaces and strategies for these groups. It is not about having teachers that “know it all” in terms of technology, but rather it is key that they are open to learn and evolve in a universe of change. Teachers’ and practitioners’ own DMLskills need constant developing and updating, and it is they who will ensure that whatever program is developed could be adapted and updated as new tools arise and new students join the group.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThere is a need to expand DML training programs for teachers and explore ways for teachers to learn continuously and informally, both among themselves and with their students. Some of the most important challenges are related not to technology itself, but to the recognition of students’ and teachers’ learning abilities, lack of access, and the need to surpass certain misconceptions about learning and evaluation (like the fact that the only valuable learning experiences happen inside of the school or that learning can only be measured through quantitative methods). Most of the skills educators are aiming for—reading media critically, being able to write and read comprehensively, and develop a certain independence when interacting with different digital environments—remain similar to those of the past and continue to be necessary to be able to take advantage of the new powerful tools we see rising today.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDML benefits from “patchwork blankets” and alliances\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eWhen developing DML programs, it is important to remember that digital literacy is not a singular concept but instead encompasses various other important literacies and skills.

That way, the focus of the program can be more adaptable to current contexts.

These pillars are: 1) the importance of student participation, 2) the need to design for social interactivity, and 3) apply a user-centered approach (which involves personalizing materials and content).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMoravec, J., Cobo, C., \u003ca href=\"https://www2.educationfutures.com/books/aprendizajeinvisible/en/\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eInvisible learning: toward a new ecology of education\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

It is an expansion of their text \"What is transmedia learning and how to promote it?\". One of the main premises of the book is the construction of a polyphonic dialogue between entertainment narratives and formal education content to promote learning. In this way, students' cultural interests can be integrated into didactic sequences of different subjects or even in civic education actions. The work includes a first part dedicated to the design and production of transmedia narratives.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eHere, it reflects on contemporary literacy and proposes a new definition of \"transliteracy\" and a model of competencies required in these learning and teaching scenarios. In its definition, it is essential to consider the diversity of contexts, practices, and resources involved in the process of transliteracy, considering the multimodal and hybrid nature of students' own life experiences. In the second part, the author focuses on transmedia logics, emphasizing the importance of the student and their motivations, creative capacity, and collaborative forms of knowledge creation and learning.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThe case studies, described ethnographically, are detailed in chapter 3.

In this context, the material we choose to work with (data, that is) appears to be something solid, comprehensive, authentic, perhaps even neutral and unquestionable. In some areas of data visualisation and evidence–based storytelling, we may come close to this pure notion of data. But, more often, we have to deal with the opposite scenario, in which the data we have access to is unreliable, fragmentary, imprecise, random, unpleasant, hypothetical, risky, dubious... the list goes on.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThis text will provide some examples of how to deal with such data sets and how to work through them in order to yield interesting results and stories. One method is to encourage people to look for datasets, to ask for them, to collect them and then to use them. The other approach is to be admit that the data we end up working with is questionable, if not basically sh..y. But this is the reality of trying to bring light into informational dark spaces.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eTo paraphrase the hypothesis of the Dark Forest (黑暗森林) from Liu Cixin's novel \u003cem\u003eThe Three–Body Problem\u003c/em\u003e (earlier described by Stanislaw Lem in his novel A Perfect Vacuum) – I will not go into the depth of the actual hypothesis, other than to say that it posits that the reason we cannot find others living in the known cosmos is perhaps not because there are none, but because it is better to be quiet in this dark forest and pass by safely unnoticed than to be eaten alive. To put this hypothesis in the context of Tactical Tech’s work, in questioning the way Big Tech operates and trying to expose its social and political risks, they, Big Tech and its acolytes, maintain a high level of signal ambiguity (not silence, but ambiguity) on their part. It is as if you are dealing with an elusive substance (the dark matter, the silence of outer space – in our case we call it simply “grey data”) that makes it difficult to make definitive conclusions, and which hides any significant notions of negative impact. At the same time, these same companies and businesses have a sophisticated apparatus that knows a lot about the users of their services and infrastructure (on which we, the users, often depend). If you manage to lift the carpet a little too successfully, you are either flagged as a rule–breaker, or, again following the dark forest principle, you are silenced (fired from your job like some AI experts, your social media monitored or otherwise ridiculed, etc.).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSo maybe instead of stretching the Dark Forest Hypothesis too much – we should give it a new name: while not wanting to use gaslighting (emotional abuse), we should perhaps call it the Great Silicon Valley Swindle, a kind of sophisticated multi–actor deception in which one group is told to give up their data for free and dependable services while the other groups is asked to give money for influence. The third group is told that you support fundamental freedoms and build tools for society and democracy, even while you are increasing polarisation, radicalisation etc….

The red set contains all of the publicly available admissions, apologies, lessons learned, pledges and promises made by Mark Zuckerberg from 2003, when he launched his first product called Facemash, until the end of 2019 (when we made the object, just after the Cambridge Analytica scandal).

One way of approaching this would be to weigh all the public statements Zuckerberg has made against all the questions he has been asked by policy makers, which might lead to some interesting conclusions, such as some of the questions were naive, or that they were asking about things he had already promised to fix or apologised for a long time ago. Or we could try to make some sense of his public voice (statements) versus his inner voice (the internal crib sheet). Would we learn more than that these two voices seem contradictory?\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eOur assumption was the opposite: we assumed these data sets were incomparable – a classic case of apples and oranges. Comparing them will not reveal anything meaningful. On the other hand, seeing how incomparable these sets are is already a story we wanted to tell, and we wanted to let the audience explore it at their own pace and interest. We were aware that for some, particularly in San Francisco where we were showing the object, it might be an insight into how you should or could run a company that wants to “move fast and break things,” and for others, it might be an illustration of the immense gap between those who break the rules and those who define them, and the fact that a company like Facebook defines far more rules than it breaks. The modus operandi of Big Tech companies is to enter unregulated territories at the intersection of new technologies, society and politics, push as far as they can into the first cracks they see, and then activate their legal and lobbying apparatuses to mitigate potential damage, while continuing to push into other areas that are not yet on anyone's radar, especially those whose radars are clearly out of date.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThe two pages immortalised by the AP photographer are a tiny, specific and fragmentary glimpse into the strategy of a multi-billion-dollar company at risk of losing the public’s trust, being advised to come clean and with as few consequences for the business itself as possible. In the end, the scandal cost Facebook 643,000 USD in the UK and a 5 billion civil penalty in the US. Including legal costs and other costs the whole defence doesn’t compare with their 2019 revenue, clocked at seventy billion US dollars. The fine paid equalled roughly 7.1% of its annual revenue. And how should we interpret Zuckerberg's devotion to jiu–jitsu, which recently made him win some tournament medals? If you are wondering what this has to do with anything, jiu–jitsu (in particular the Brazilian jiu–jitsu he prefers) is one of the few martial arts that specialises in diverting and deflecting the force of an opponent, a masterclass in dodging.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch2\u003e“You might regret what you wish for” data\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn 2016, together with artist Joana Moll, Tactical Tech decided to test the following hypothesis: it is possible to buy a lot of personal data legally and openly. At the time, there were many discussions about what kind of data was and wasn’t available, and affordable, along with a lot of questions about how the data broker business works. But there weren't so many documented examples. So the idea was to focus specifically on data from dating websites (as it is, by default, very personal) and to use only legal and open forms of data brokering (no dark net data buying). We identified the US broker website (in case you want to replicate our process – it is not possible for the datasets we got access to – thanks to Joana's and our research) and went online to buy some records. We decided to buy 1 million profiles for 136 euros from a service called Usdata, paying with our credit card.

The point of our investigation was to make users of web services based on detailed profiles aware of the consequences of sharing data with relatively unknown companies with unclear privacy policies and undisclosed business models. Our aim was not to expose any of the personal data we might get our hands on, and certainly not to expose any users who have already fallen victim to terrible data practices.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSo how do you show the results of your research?

By extracting the metadata from the images, they were able to reverse-engineer a hidden network of companies owned by other companies that apparently shared their data without users' consent across many of their own dating services (please read the actual research mentioned above). By analysing all the websites, they unraveled a vast network of third parties that enabled cookies and trackers (which do allow advertising) were given access to collect live data from users of the above dating services. They counted over 300 third–party cookies on sites owned by Match Group and IAC (which owns most of the dating sites that you know very well and those you may have never heard of).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eJoana's key principle in the research, and in the artistic project that came out of this collaboration, was not to expose the people behind the data that we had access to. And yet we felt it was important to show the nature and scale of the data that was being processed and that was available to anyone, even with limited resources. The research part was easier to manage from this perspective – as the data we had was used as a source for expanding the research and collecting company data – there was no risk of exposing the data we had.

It is updated every three minutes or so. There is no way for the visitor to make their own request or ask for specific data sets, but you can of course move between these randomised data sets extracted from the 1 million profiles. Each auction has a price tag: it is not a price you have to pay, but rather a provocation to get the visitor to evaluate what a price could or should be for such detailed and personal data sets. If you decide to 'buy' (there is no transaction involved – the project does not collect any data from its visitors), you will see pictures (in blue) of all the people whose data is being auctioned. By clicking on a picture, you can look at a specific individual record. Joana decided to go to the limit in terms of possible exposure of people, minimising this risk as much as possible. For the provocation to be a provocation, she had to retain an element of risk – either of finding oneself in the dataset, or of finding people one might know. However, the following steps make this almost impossible. There is no way to access the entire raw data set. The data is presented in randomised chunks – where there is no way for the visitor to interrogate it. You cannot search for any names, places or other variables – there is no way to query, filter or explore the data. All you are given is a random small subset of data every three minutes – there is no way to go back to previous auctions, either. The images used are blurred. There is also an emergency button to remove a face, as despite all the efforts to blur faces (automated) there is a small chance that some of the faces might still be borderline recognisable. The emergency button allows people interacting in the data to immediately trigger the removal of the face from the dataset.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Scavengers6.png\" alt=\"Joanna Moll, taken in May 2023\"\u003e The snapshot of the images view from the random Auction, Joana Moll, taken in May 2023\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThis uncanny part of the project (the potential of finding yourself or someone you know), which triggers our worst buyer's instincts, is essential to the project.

What we exposed specifically in relation to dating sites is no different when it comes to any and all online based services that generate their income/revenue by hosting such advertising, sponsored content or third-party cookies.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAnother investigation certainly raises a lot of moral questions about who collects, who exposes, who is exposed, and whether they should be.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Scavengers7.png\" alt=\"Exposing the Invisible 2015\"\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003cem\u003eScreen shot of the series of interviews with M.C.

McGrath in 2015 for our Exposing The Invisible project, to introduce and explain the tool he had previously created, called ICWATCH. The tool he created consisted at the time of a database of an estimated 27,000 LinkedIn CVs of people working in the intelligence sector. The method of obtaining the data was very simple – M.C. ran a script that looked for any CV posted on LinkedIn that might have mentioned any of the code words relating to specific intelligence, surveillance and similar secret projects. It turned out that people working in this sector, looking for new opportunities, inevitably needed to use some recognisable references and professional slang that would prove their experience and expertise. M.C., driven by different principles, decided not to protect the identities of all these 27,000 or so people, but to expose them. His decision was based on the assumption that this data is available to everyone, that anyone can run similar scripts, and that it is in itself a security threat to a sector that should be more aware of it and able to do something about it.

Ambient Intelligence: solutions are mostly based on large-scale (populations) and largely depersonalised data (this is not to say that it is not possible to de–anonymise these datasets, but the technologies do not require this, per se).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2. Biometric Intelligence: unlike technologies that rely on ambient intelligence, the source is always a specific individual. Data is aggregated and so on, but the link to the subject is the closest, such as in technologies like personal trackers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3. Mobility Intelligence: from today's point of view, this will not really stand out as a significant category, but at the time the data was collected, this was one of the dominant problems – how to manage mobility in a dangerous environment, that is, when mobility amplifies the spread of the virus.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e4. Behavioural Intelligence: this may look like a version of biometric intelligence, but it's not. Here, we're talking about individual and group behaviour and how to control it (such as behaviour in crowded places) as well as how to modify it by training people to develop new behaviour, specifically in places like offices, schools, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAs noted above, the purpose of this data snapshot was not to provide a comprehensive overview of all the technologies that are being developed and promoted, but rather to try to capture what they are potentially normalising, as opposed to what would have been difficult to talk about prior to the crisis. One clear example here is location data: many companies would not readily admit that they had access to and processed such data. On the other hand, we also observed a significant push to normalise the use of space and behavioural control tools that would have been considered invasive prior to the pandemic, such as closed circuit camera networks with sensors, or sensor networks that monitor people in spaces. Another important observation we were able to make is that the majority of critical technological capabilities in times of crisis are in the hands of the private sector, not the public sector.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eBut to make it even more interesting and intriguing, we decided to screenshot every single website promoting the tools in focus and link them to their promotional videos. In many cases we had to use the Internet Archive – as solutions were coming and going very quickly, which we saw as a feature of the project rather than a problem. We found it fascinating the kinds of individual metaphors and narratives used by these companies to promote their solutions, and we wanted to present them for visitors to explore and draw their own conclusions.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eLooking at it post–pandemic, we can see a ring of debris left behind by all these technological solutions, like the ring of defunct satellites littering Earth's orbit.

Maybe you’re thinking, because we are scavenging for unpolished datasets,we may be undermining the quality of our work. Those with a scientific or investigative mindset might believe that you should keep searching for clean data rather than making assumptions. However, I hope that this text shows two important things: a) scavenging is not bad - someone has to deal with messy stuff and recycle it and b) while you cannot produce reliable results based on unreliable source material , this unreliability, for us, is the actual story. Part of our work is to expose the unreliability of such datasets, and seek narratives that should trigger changes in what information is collected, by whom, who is responsible for it, and who is accountable for it. Rather than hopelessly waiting for someone to give us a bundle of clean data that we can use, we want to expose what narratives are hiding in the available data.

The letter spins an elaborate tale of fortune and misfortune, in which an assistant to an aristocrat was forced to hide his gold and diamonds in the countryside to avoid capture from hostile military forces. When returning to retrieve the stowed fortune, he was apprehended and arrested for resembling a wanted fugitive. To make matters worse, he didn’t have any identification documents on him.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAccording to the letter, a treasure map was hidden in a false bottom of his suitcase, which he can dispatch to your relative. The only hitch, as it were, is that he was forced to sell his suitcase to a prison guard, and so all your relative had to do was send a comparatively small sum to the letter writer, so that they may buy back their suitcase from the prison guard, and in turn send them the concealed treasure map.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eYou chuckle, reading the letter, and hope that your relative never actually sent money for the suitcase that would surely never arrive.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eA week later, you receive an out-of-the-blue email from someone who claims to be a person of “substantial means,” currently in the infirmary in a distant country, unable to travel owing to COVID.

The only hitch is that they looked into the international money transfer, and a certain comparatively small percentage will be required upfront, which the email writer cannot presently afford, so could you do them the kindness of paying these initial transfer fees, which you can then compensate yourself for by taking the fees from the writer's account...\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-9-lives-of-the-spanish-prisoner-the-treasure-dangling-scam-that-wont-die\"\u003eadvance-fee fraud has existed for more than 200 years\u003c/a\u003e, with scammers adapting the particular elements to leverage current social trends. The underlying mechanics of the scam, however, have fundamentally remained unchanged: the lure is the promise of a substantial future reward in exchange for a comparatively small upfront payment. The reward never comes, while the scammer pockets the money paid upfront.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Mechanics of a Scam\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eA scam, swindle, or con is essentially a confidence trick. That is to say, the underlying objective of a scam is to trick you into having undue confidence in what someone says or does, based on deceptive or untrue pretenses. For instance, if a scammer contacts you and pretends to be your bank representative, then they are effectively trying to trick you into having confidence that it’s safe to tell them your private information, as they are ostensibly from your bank.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSpecifically, \u003cstrong\u003escammers are typically after something you have that is desirable to them\u003c/strong\u003e, which may be your money, your possessions, or even just information. Although the number of methods scammers use is quite vast, in general scams follow predictable blueprints. Once you learn the three common structures of scams, \u003cstrong\u003eyou'll be able to spot scammers\u003c/strong\u003e, and help others do the same.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGive a little now, get a lot later\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eScammers may try to lure you into their con by posing the enticing prospect of a vast future reward, as long as you make a minimal payment up front. For instance, a scammer may say that they'll share a percentage of their millionaire inheritance with you, provided you help them with some comparatively paltry international transfer fees. The scammer may even reference current economic turmoil in a particular country, plucked from news headlines—scammers often reference current events in attempts to make old scams stay relevant.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAnother variation of a ‘give a little now, get a lot later’ scam flips the script: instead of you first giving the scammer a comparatively small sum, it is the scammer who instead gives you a gift or a small amount of funds preemptively, with the expectation that you’ll then give the scammer much more in return.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eFor instance, in an investment scam, a scammer may promise you a large return on your investment, and may say that they’ll allow you to make a small investment with them (much smaller than they typically allow their clients to make), to test the waters. If you invest a handful of money, the scammer may then put back an amount that’s 150% of your investment, showing you the prospect of large returns. When you then invest a much larger amount, expecting a similar percentage of returns, the scammer strings you along for as long as possible before ultimately absconding with your money.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eA modern variant of this type of scam involves the scammer setting up a fake cryptocurrency exchange website, and then contacting you out of the blue to notify you that your account has some money in this exchange. Once you log in, it appears you do indeed have funds in the account. If you try withdrawing the funds, you receive a notification that you can only withdraw a tiny percentage of the funds, in order to verify your account. The small withdrawal works, and so you then try to withdraw the rest of the funds. At this point, the website informs you that you’re a bit below the minimum full withdrawal amount, and you need to add more money before you can withdraw the full amount. Once you do so, and then attempt to withdraw the full amount, the website greets you with a temporary error and tells you to try again later. The scammer has by now absconded with your deposit.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe too-good discount\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eScammers often offer goods and services at a steep discount. For instance, they may sell electronics, medicine, or tickets to popular events for a fraction of the retail cost. The scammer always has some excuse to explain away the low cost—it's a result of an overstock, or they just urgently need money quickly to cover medical expenses—and may attempt to offer various proofs of authenticity, for instance showing doctored receipts or certificates.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eWhen you buy the item, you invariably discover that it doesn't work; for instance, the concert ticket doesn't scan when you take it to the venue, or when you look inside the suspiciously cheap computer you bought, you find that it's empty or full of junk parts.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eNote, however, that something being priced suspiciously low is not the only indicator of a potential swindle. Sophisticated scammers are aware of the fact that savvy consumers may be suspicious of too-good-to-be-true deals, and so may instead price their fraudulent wares at low, but not extravagantly low prices. Instead of focusing solely on the price of a good or service, check the reputation of the purported vendor—have they had complaints lodged against them, have people you know and trust had good experiences with them? Be cautious, however, of false reviews, as scammers can purchase or otherwise scam positive reviews on popular websites.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch2\u003eServing the public good\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eWhile the previous two types of scams typically appeal to people’s desires to strike a good deal, a third tier of scams preys on our predilection to serve the public good. Scammers may fraudulently claim to represent charities—either real or fictitious—or claim that they're members of law enforcement and ask you to help in an investigation.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eFor example, in a convoluted 'courier scam', a scammer may call you and claim that they're conducting a police investigation at your local bank, and need you to withdraw funds to help them test if the bills are counterfeit. After you withdraw your money, the scammer asks you to read out the serial numbers on the bills. The scammer then claims that based on the serial numbers, they are able to tell that the bills are indeed counterfeit and that the police will promptly dispatch a courier to your home to collect the cash you withdrew (they may make further mention of the fact that you will be compensated for the amount you withdrew by the bank at the end of the investigation, and hand you a phony claims receipt).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe common link in all scams\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eNo matter what form a scam takes, all scams ultimately ask you to provide something, whether it is money, goods or services, or information. Always be cautious of requests for any of these things from you, which may come from strangers, or scammers posing as officials, or friends or relatives. Keep in mind that scammers are often some of the first adopters of new technologies, leveraging the public’s unfamiliarity with the emerging technologies to perpetuate their frauds. For instance, scammers have already used \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/05/ai-voice-scam/\"\u003eAI-generated voices to impersonate relatives\u003c/a\u003e when calling people to ask for money.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThough the underlying mechanics of a scam typically remain the same, scammers are always tweaking their operations to leverage new technologies and exploit current events. Furthermore, disinformation and scams can go hand-in-hand. In the wake of natural disasters, pandemics, war, and civil unrest, disinformation can be used as a vehicle for promoting scams, such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.usa.gov/covid-scams\"\u003ethose reported during the COVID-19 pandemic\u003c/a\u003e (listen to this explored in \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/02/1126480393/after-the-storm-the-scams-lies-and-misinformation-flood-in\"\u003ean NPR discussion here\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThe connection between scams and spam (which are typically communications from out-of-the-blue sources, some of which may be fraudulent) is also important.

Educated and privileged people have spread hateful messages on social media and WhatsApp groups justifying acts of violence. I see more and more young people fall prey to hate, normalized in their own homes and in the media they consume. Through the education of media narratives and helping young people be more aware of the algorithms which dominate or will dominate their lives, I hope that those I engage with do not easily fall for these messages. \u003cem\u003eLogo courtesy of Media Net\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTT: Could you share some insights into the collaboration with Tactical Tech?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAG: The partnership has been extremely beneficial.

In which case, the usefulness of such a map would be rather questionable. Still, the idea of creating a map like this belongs in the category of pure speculation, based on the premise that one would have total access to all possible information to create it and to process such an improbable amount of data.  It is so easy to debunk this notion it took Jorge Luis Borges a paragraph to describe it in his 1946 \"On Exactitude in Science.\" (2) Yet the idea of Total Information Awareness still prevails (3), from the national security services to Silicon Valley and Shenzhen. The idea can be summed up in one sentence: If only we could collect all the information out there, we could prevent what needs to be prevented and predict what needs to be predicted – while making piles of profit and living a peaceful and beautiful life in the name of preventing terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you map an empire from a disadvantaged position, you have a situation that is a bit like using binoculars the other way around. The empire is looking at us (the subjects) through a ridiculously large telescope, seeing all the little details, while we are looking at it from the other side, obviously seeing it at an impossible distance, with minimal detail, even further away than it actually is...(4) But perhaps this disadvantage can be turned into a useful method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what are you left with when you try to map the empire of the five Big Tech companies, one of them, or other companies that benefit from the sophisticated digital infrastructure that the big five have amassed and control? You are left trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I describe some of it, let's first clarify why we call the Google (Alphabet) empire, or GAFAM (an acronym for Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our understanding of empire here is very basic: empire controls three basic layers of knowledge: 1) collection of data/intelligence, 2) storage of that intelligence, as well as 3) capacity of processing it. These three unique characteristics give them powerful and unprecedented insights into how our societies operate.” (05) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's somewhat arbitrary to use the term “empire” at this point, but let's stick with it for a while, just for the sake of argument. The same goes for the use of the term “knowledge” or ”intelligence,” but isn't that what collected data becomes when used to train various machine-learning and AI models?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAfter all, we are in the business of provocation design (06). This is what we do here - we turn limited data, corrupted information and grey areas into engaging and stimulating visual prompts for critical thinking.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of mapping the unprecedented influence of big tech companies, using all the methods available, including licencia poetica (07), is to try to demystify, on the one hand, who these companies are and, on the other hand, the powerful tools they have at their disposal. These are tools they use to influence how we perceive what is important, how we understand, for example, what a crisis is through the lens of technology, or simply how we are going to vote in the next election.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have an interesting history of many fragile, semi-confusing, but amusing and successful attempts at such mapping. We are a tiny fish in this vast ocean. But we have our tools and our ideas. We are persistently putting together different narratives to engage different audiences in different ways with a subject that is often seen as slightly over the top (\"it's the market, stupid\"), mostly boring (\"another network map, ugh\"), and at best too technical (\"data?\") and at worst too politically biased (\"you just hate corporations, don't you?\").\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, mapping what we can see against what we cannot see can be beautiful at first, but in the long run, it can also risk representing truly problematic views. Let me take an old example, Edward Quin’s Maps of Empire (08).  Here are three examples from his original atlas:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_2.png\" alt=\"Edward Quin, Maps of Empire, 1830\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eEdward Quin, Maps of Empire, 1830 (here Alexander, Constantine and Discovery of America) images after David Rumsey Historical Map Collection - \u003ca href=\"https://www.davidrumsey.com\"\u003ehttps://www.davidrumsey.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Quin’s case, mapping is presented as a rather romantic candlelight that, over time, dispels the cloud of ignorance, showing the progress of knowledge directly related to the power of cartographers representing a very specific imperial viewpoint. First, it is assumed that expansion equals knowledge - as if the territories unknown to the cartographers and their inhabitants did not exist before. The act of cartography is subjective and political (09). The other thing we learn from this example is that visualising is associated with immediate discovery for the viewer. It is a very empowering act. In Quin's case, it ended with reprinting his atlas, omitting all his writing in favour of just the images in many future atlas editions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe like to see things in linear progress, from darkness to light, from not knowing to enlightenment, etc. But there is something else to learn from this example, and that is how much we can learn from so-called negative space - not from what is visible, but from what is bluntly invisible. One of these things is the bias and limited perspective of the mapmaker himself. It is crucial to be aware of this limitation. And perhaps the final and somewhat exaggerated lesson from this example is that no empire should map itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Growing Pains of Mapping an Empire\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's go back to our journey through our various attempts to explore how to visualise and represent the unprecedented position that the big tech companies have gained in recent decades in terms of their impact on our society. We explored how to tell the story using different data sets, which data sets to choose and how to present them in an interesting way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started with the obvious - the “follow the money” mantra. Why follow the money (10)? Because when money is present, there are transactions; when there are transactions, there are values (not only monetary), and there is power. So when we talk about Big Tech, we, in fact, talk about a sector that processes lots of money, more than we can actually imagine: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGAFAM’s market capitalisation counts in the trillions (11)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGAFAM is made out of the most profitable businesses in existence (12)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGAFAM holds a massive number of patents (13)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGAFAM includes the most valued brands worldwide (14)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGAFAM’s owners and CEOs are some of the wealthiest people in the world.

(16)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince we know how much money these companies make, and we somehow know how they spend it, we could make some observations here. It turns out that neither is that obvious, and both sets of data (profit, money spent on investment and acquisitions) are riddled with corporate PR, copy/paste journalism and a lack of corporate transparency. But we gave it a go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_3.png\" alt=\"Google Empire 2016, Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle Empire 2016, Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma – photo Andrea Figari (left) \u0026#x26; Daniel Desiderio Paez Castillo (right), as exhibited at the exhibition “Nervous Systems“ at HKW Berlin. (17)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe above is our first modest 3D visualisation from 2016, based on a dataset of about 180 companies that Google acquired and 400 companies that they have invested in since 1998. What we learnt very quickly compiling this dataset was that it needed to be more reliable.  It was very hard to verify the numbers we had collected; some information contradicted our initial research, and because it was much easier to look at acquisitions than investments, it was impossible to verify accuracy. We decided to simplify (the above-mentioned licencia poetica) the visual representation. It is basically a good-looking timeline where both acquisitions and investments are represented as two types of bars. While the size of the bar roughly represents the amount of money, the colour shows what kind of category a given transaction belongs to in terms of its primary field of business (such as education, robotics, etc.). We made an arbitrary decision that in cases where we had conflicting numbers (actual money spent or invested), we would average them while making it clear in the description.  It was essential to show that Google is more than what we think and definitely more than the sum of its parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon after that exhibition, we were about to show our work in New York and wanted to make a better impression there. We came up with another version based on the same dataset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_4.png\" alt=\"Google Empire, 2016 Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle Empire, 2016 Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma, New York, Glass Room exhibition produced by Mozilla, photo Tactical Tech\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time we decided to go for a network map made of nails and coloured threads, where each investment or acquisition is represented by the dot (nail), and the size of the circle represents the money spent/invested. The colour of the thread indicates the category of business, similar to the previous version. We thought this was a better representation of the size and scope of these nearly 600 deals, and we could not resist embedding Eric Schmidt's infamous quote, \"We know where you are\" (18) into the data representation itself.

Being part of the enrichment of public knowledge through our work with libraries, schools, hackerspaces, maker spaces, and community centres is also very rewarding.

We didn't think the scale or the amounts would make an impression in the heart of Silicon Valley. So we set out to create what we called “Google and You”. (23) We updated the datasets from 2016/17 and 2018 to the most recent dataset from the end of 2019. This time we excluded investments and decided to go exclusively with all known acquisitions. We ended up presenting these as a set of 250 products and services owned by Google.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_12.jpg\" alt=\"Google and You, Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle and You, Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma, 2019, photo author\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea was very simple. We decided first to show the ten most used services offered by Google (we still like to call Alphabet “Google”). We presented them as rotating plates stacked on top of each other; each plate had a dotted pattern representing the known number of current users of that service. You would think this would be easy to find out - it is not. Google sometimes gives some figures, and journalists report slightly different ones. Again, there is no transparency about how many users a particular service has, either in total or how many log on or use it each month. We chose only those that exceeded the magic number of 1 billion or more, starting with Android, which at the time had almost 3 billion users worldwide. Unlike the previous objects and visualisations, we did not want to show Google as a powerful company just because it can afford to invest and spend a lot of money to acquire other companies (which also means acquisition, talent, skills, infrastructure, code, ideas and maybe sometimes competition). Rather, we wanted to show how much we depend on its services and solutions, its hardware and software. And to show that there is much more to Google than the ten most used applications. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_13.png\" alt=\"Google and You, mock-up of the object\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGoogle and You, mock-up of the object, LaLoma, 2019\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe object was quite complicated because the elements rotated. We wanted it to look abstractly like a series of stacked Google lenses, each with a different focus (aka the number of users), hovering over the global number of internet users (24), represented as transparent mini people at the bottom of the stack, each representing 10 000,000 internauts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may have been the last time we produce such a fragile object. People loved rotating the lenses and the outer ring with 250 services. Somehow, at the end of the day, tens of the plastic people would be broken off the base plate. For the 21 days of the exhibition, I would come there early with my coffee and a tube of Super Glue and spend 30 minutes glueing them back on day after day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_14.png\" alt=\"Google and You close-up, ibidem, picture author\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle and You close-up, ibidem, picture author\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one thing that worked with this semi-interactive 3D visualisation: It brought together three parts - the staggering number of Google users, the incredible advertising revenue and the company's buying power - all growing together with the unique dependency between the majority of the world's internet users and the company. At the same time, The San Francisco Glass Room exhibition won us the Creative Review Annual Award. (25)\\\nWe were ready for the next challenge: most of our public activities were cancelled at the beginning of 2020, except for our collaboration with FERS (26) and a series of exhibitions in Dutch libraries. (27) For this occasion, we rolled up our sleeves and concentrated on producing a piece called Google Society, a better version of Google and You.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_15.jpg\" alt=\"Google Society  - Tactical Tech \u0026#x26;  LaLoma, 2020\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle Society  - Tactical Tech \u0026#x26;  LaLoma, 2020, photo author, exhibited in Leeuwarden 2021\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_16.png\" alt=\"Google Society  - Tactical Tech \u0026#x26;  LaLoma, 2020\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle Society-Tactical Tech \u0026#x26;  LaLoma, 2020, photo author, exhibited in Leeuwarden 2021\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe updated the dataset again and rearranged the object, which looks like a modern version of a camera obscura (28) or a giant artificial jellyfish, ready for the digital world to conquer.  On one side, we have the user's view in the form of an idealised mobile phone surface, with its shiny mirrored surface with the ten most popular apps on it. On the opposite side, we have the Google eye, where its retina is made up of all sorts of personal data collected as it peers through the web of connections between the hundreds of services it offers. The side view gives more space to contemplate the tangled web of interdependencies among all of Google's services. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe backdrop remained the same, as in the images below: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_17.png\" alt=\"Google Society  - Tactical Tech \u0026#x26;  LaLoma, 2020\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle Society, fragments of the visualisation key from the baseplate explaining all the elements and data used to produce the piece.

Practically three weeks before our original idea of launching GAFAM Empire on 21 April 2021, the Washington Post published their “How Big Tech Got So Big: Hundreds of Acquisitions35.” (34)  There were far too many similarities between their work and ours that we decided to postpone and rethink our approach, as well as see where we could add something the Washington Post piece did not have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_20.png\" alt=\"Initial data analysis of our GAFAM empire from early 2021\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eInitial data analysis of our GAFAM empire from early 2021, research Patrick Harvey, Data Analysis and categorisation Basile Simon (35).\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir piece focused on two aspects of big tech acquisitions - first, that they are different from what they were when they started. Second, that they get big as Company A, and then they spend the money on acquisitions and become Company B. For example, Amazon started as an online bookstore and became a cloud computing powerhouse, but to everyday users, they are mostly known as a retail company. The data team at the Washington Post did some really great visualisations. But they reduced it to a timeline. More importantly, they made it clear that their efforts, much like ours, were designed to help institutions and policymakers (the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, respectively) in their fight against these companies using their monopolistic positions to a) weaken competitors and b) strengthen their grip on particular sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe returned to the drawing board and decided to wait and update the dataset and give it more nuance and depth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/gafam_evolution.png\" alt=\"One of the visualisations of GAFAM Empire 2022\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eOne of the visualisations of GAFAM Empire 2022, Tactical Tech and Density Design - we called this part Petri dishes - where we observed changes in the landscape of acquisitions in 5-year intervals. (36)\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing we focused on, and what makes our work very different from that of the Washington Post, was the problem of categorising the 1,210 acquisitions we were looking at. We quickly learnt that this was purely arbitrary, not very precise and often more PR than anything else - companies acquired might be described as just \"software\". In contrast, on closer inspection, we could say they were \"developers of mobile recognition engines for the mobile phone and consumer electronics industries, and more.\" We dug wherever we could: press, reports, company filings, and so on.  This allowed us to make much more specific observations about what these acquisitions were really about - although still with many limitations - as it is not possible to really determine why these acquisitions were made. Was the company acquiring some expertise, code, patents, ideas, talent, user base, data - some or all of it, or simply neutralising a potential competitor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing we decided to look at, which was part of the inspiring Washington Post investigation, is what we can learn about these companies through their acquisition strategies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, our findings also overlap with the Washington Post. Still, in the case of Amazon, for example, their focus is on Amazon's transition from an e-commerce giant to a cloud computing \"landlord.\" What our observations add is that they are also the most significant player in automation and robotics. In the case of Google, the Washington Post observed that they transitioned from an advertising giant to a dominant force in mobile and artificial intelligence and digital mapping. Our observations also show Google's strategic dominance in education and health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_22.png\" alt=\"GAFAM Empire – fragment of Microsoft acquisitions\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGAFAM Empire – a fragment of Microsoft acquisitions – LinkedIn, Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; Density Design 2022 (37).\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also spent significant time trying to decipher their business strategies, looking not only at the actual acquisition in focus - as in the case above of Microsoft buying LinkedIn - but also scrutinising what companies like LinkedIn had bought before becoming part of Microsoft's portfolio, as well as what companies they acquired after being owned by Microsoft. In fact, researchers at the Transnational Institute took note and looked at Meta's series of purchases made via the acquisition of Oculus and how they expanded their reach into VR technologies (38). There are many cases of such complex acquisitions by all of the Big Five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the last thing that made it a big bonus for researchers and policymakers is that we published all the data in our Methodology section for scrutiny and use (39).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is not the end of our mapping adventures - we are now working on simplified versions of the GAFAM Empire, another poster, an animation and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever we do next, we could do a lot better (or more generally, we as policymakers, researchers and institutions could do a lot better in terms of better understanding the impact of these companies at large) if a few basic things were available, such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edetailed financial reports from companies that are useful to regulators and researchers (in particular, disclosing the specific purposes of acquisitions and investments, with business plans describing the intended use of acquired assets)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edetailed non-financial reports explaining the purposes of acquisitions, including inventories listing what has been acquired\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edetailed information about monetisation metrics – it is essential to know the money-making strategies and tools used by companies (what is specifically being monetised for what value?

It also assumes, as we said at the beginning, that all we need is more data, more information. To some extent, it would certainly help to define new rules of the game (new policies, regulations, restrictions, rights and responsibilities). Once again, the map becomes larger than the empire that looms around the corner.\nThe point we are making is that mapping as a process is crucial to finding ways of understanding and measuring power relations. It also helps us to get a basic orientation - where are we in this? And more importantly, all maps are temporary - by the time they are finished, they are already out of date. So it is fascinating to look at the processes and methods behind the maps while enjoying their visual representation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile - we will keep mapping.

This became even more widespread after the COVID-19 pandemic. Many privately owned websites have become people’s first access point when they are sick or need to find out what is happening with their bodies. As a consequence, companies such as Google and Facebook, among others, can track what in the past would have only been discussed between doctors and patients. This puts many people’s health data at risk. When this health data concerns people’s reproductive lives, risks for everyone involved are even higher because reproduction is heavily controlled and restricted by governments worldwide (To read more about people’s struggles to access abortions worldwide, take a look at this article on The Telegraph “\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/women-and-girls/new-abortion-surveillance-state-keeping-tabs-women/\"\u003eAbortion surveillance\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e”).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surveillance of reproductive health takes a different shape in each context. In Poland, for example, abortion was made almost entirely illegal in 2021 and, one year later, in the government suggested the introduction of a centralised register requiring doctors to report all pregnancies (whether carried to term or ended pre-term). While the Polish government claimed this was part of a larger project of digitising health data, activists feared this register could be used against those who self-administer abortions (Read more about Poland on the Guardian’s article “\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/03/poland-plans-to-set-up-register-of-pregnancies-to-report-miscarriages\"\u003ePoland plans to set up register of pregnancies to report miscarriages\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e”). In Poland, conflicts around reproductive health surveillance concerned state-led development of digital registers. Similarly, in India, surveillance about reproductive health also focused on state digitization programs, even though in 2022 abortion in India had become legally more accessible for all, except for those chronically disenfranchised—such as the Dalit—who can still not afford them.\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote1sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(1) In this article, I do not focus on reproductive surveillance by states, but on the intersections between data collection by private companies and the policing of people’s reproductive rights by states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData about reproduction, and especially menstruation, is being tracked and gathered by many different companies,(2)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote2sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e without people’s awareness of the extent or the financial value this data has, nor the possible consequences for them individually or the collective harm.(3)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote3sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAfter the right to abortion was struck down in the United States in 2022,(4)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote4sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e conversations about the surveillance of people’s reproductive lives sparked unprecedented public attention, which reverberated through the media globally. These debates were largely focused on data security, period trackers, and abortions but there were significant gaps in this discourse, which I address here. First, the focus on period tracking apps sidelined the systemic ways in which all our online interactions are tracked, datafied, and monetized in Surveillance Capitalism which can also expose people accessing abortions. Second, I outline how data on menstruation is not just sought after by governments and individuals policing people’s reproduction and access to abortion, but this data is valuable for many companies working in advertising. Finally, drawing on a Reproductive Justice framework, it is crucial to consider how the risks and obstacles we face online/offline are not the same. Marginalised groups are more at risk when it comes to surveillance and their reproductive rights have historically been grossly violated. It is crucial to center these histories, solidarity and mutual care in a discussion on pathways out of this overwhelming situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt’s not just about period trackers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2022, the United States Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, which had constitutionally protected the right to abortion, and period tracking apps quickly became a focal point in the conversation around surveillance and reproductive rights. Tweets calling on people to delete their period trackers were quickly spread on social media.\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote5sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(5) Articles on whether to delete an app and how to do it proliferated. Alternatives to period tracking apps, such as Google Spreadsheets, were suggested and shared on Instagram and TikTok—often without mentioning that tracking information in a spreadsheet owned by Google would do nothing but shift the problem from one company’s database to another (To read more about different (and safe) methods to track your cycle, take a look at \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/health/cycles-of-influence/\"\u003e“Cycles of Influence: Decide who knows your body”\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e).

Those platforms barely received any attention in the post-\u003cem\u003eRoe v. Wade\u003c/em\u003e conversation; worse, the focus on deleting period apps might have left people with a false sense of security.\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote7sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(7) Instead, the conversation framed both the problem and solution as one of individual privacy and as choice between an app or a different tracking method. But when we situate the discussion how menstrual data could put people at risk in the broader context of the routine tracking, selling and buying of people’s data, a very different picture emerges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, the business model of most technology or Internet companies—be they period trackers, social media platforms, or data brokers—is deeply connected to a large market for data (To find out more about data brokers and their influence in elections, read “\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://influenceindustry.org/en/explorer/\"\u003eThe Influence Industry Explorer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e”). Most of these institutions, driven by a ‘data imperative,’\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote8sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(8) aim to extract as much data as possible, from anywhere, by any means possible. Data on users is accumulated by different actors who then either sell or share this data or aggregate it and sell access to user profiles or insights into this data. Data is also collected because of its assumed future value: the potential to use data to develop new products, new algorithms or other unknown technologies.\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote9sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(9) This system has been given many different names: \u003cem\u003eSurveillance Capitalism\u003c/em\u003e,\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote10sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(10) \u003cem\u003eInformational Capitalism\u003c/em\u003e,\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote11sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(11) or \u003cem\u003edata capitalism\u003c/em\u003e. Today, this system of corporate surveillance also enables governments to access people’s private information. State institutions—policing people’s reproductive or other rights—can either request access to people’s private information from companies,\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote12sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(12) require them by law to submit information through a \u003cem\u003esubpoena\u003c/em\u003e,\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote13sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(13) or even buy data sets on the market.\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote14sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(14) For example, the Texas anti-abortion law enables civilians to seek civil damages in court against anyone assisting in providing abortions—from doctors to even family members (Read more on \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/ask-experts/is-abortion-banned-in-texas-under-s-b-8\"\u003ePlanned Parenthood\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e’s website about how the law works). With data being so widely and easily available, this also enables individuals to tap into this data market to target individuals providing abortions. Therefore, a wider focus on how companies collect data and monetize needs to be part of the analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour period data is valuable\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInformation on people’s menstrual cycle is very much part of the kinds of data sets that are shared and sold. This might come as quite a surprise to people with or without periods because of the shame, stigma and silence that surrounds menstruation in public discourse, but data about periods are very valuable to many institutions, from governments to researchers, data brokers and advertising companies. How you track your cycle and for what purpose can also reveal a lot about your political convictions and help data brokers develop a more comprehensive profile of you and allow companies working in the influence industry to target you with political ads which have been influencing election outcomes worldwide (To read more about this, take a look at this article “\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ourdataourselves.tacticaltech.org/posts/psychometric-profiling/\"\u003ePsychometric Profiling: Persuasion by Personality in Elections\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e”). In addition, the apps and platforms targeted at women—referred to as “FemTech” in the tech industry—have become a booming business, projected to become a USD 50 billion industry by 2025 (read details on \u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/estrellajaramillo/2019/12/17/femtech-in-2019-trends-investment-in-womens-health-technology/%2332e7348d114c\"\u003eForbes\u003c/a\u003e).

It is ironic that FemTech apps—which promise to fill the gaps in existing knowledge over reproductive knowledge—are also the same apps that make people more vulnerable to surveillance.(15)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote15sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMenstrual and other health data can reveal very intimate details about you, your body, and your habits and can be used for many different purposes: to create advertisements that try to exploit (real or perceived) hormonal fluctuations, to determine whether or not someone is pregnant or trying to become pregnant, something advertisers and governments or even potential employers want to know, or to create insights into your overall health. In addition, a practice known as cycle-based advertising seeks to exploit the hormonal changes that take place during the menstrual cycle. Kristina Durante, professor in Marketing, argues that because during ovulation cis-women’s oestrogen levels are high, they are subconsciously more interested in attracting a mate and more competitive vis-a-vis other women (over finding a mate).(16)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote16sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Consequently, Durante argues that during ovulation, cis-women are more susceptible to advertisements for products that help them with these goals: for example, red lipstick or lingerie. Durante’s arguments are based on evolutionary psychology and she has published extensively on the topic (read her paper “\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.business.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/documents/durante-ovulation-female-competition-product-choice-2011.pdf\"\u003eOvulation, Female Competition, and Product Choice: Hormonal Influences on Consumer Behavior\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e”).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeriod tracking applications, for example, facilitate how companies and governments find out about people’s reproductive choices. In a 2019 study by Privacy International, a UK charity working on privacy issues, researchers found that Maya, a popular period tracker with more than 5 million downloads on Google Play, informs Facebook when a user opens the app.(17)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote17sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e This piece of data reveals already a lot about users: that they have a menstrual cycle, and that they possibly might be trying (or avoiding) to have a baby. Crucially, Maya shared data with Facebook before users agreed to the privacy policy. But period trackers are not the only companies in the business of monetizing data about reproduction. Advertising companies who sell location-based information also monetize data about pregnant people and by extension can reveal who has accessed an abortion clinic. One example of these tools is Geofencing, which allows the targeting people at a certain location with specific ads (This article on “\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ourdataourselves.tacticaltech.org/posts/geotargeting/\"\u003eGeotargeting: The Political Value of Your Location\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e” explains how this works in more details). This technology has been used by anti-abortion and Christian groups to target people in Planned Parenthood waiting rooms with anti-choice messages.(18)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote18sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Another example is SafeGraph, a company which has sold information about people visiting clinics that also provide abortions. Even though SafeGraph sold anonymised information about groups of people, they also included the locations people came from, how long they stayed at the clinic, and where they went afterwards. This set of information makes it easier to reverse the anonymisation of the dataset(19)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote19sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e After this was revealed publicly, SafeGraph discontinued this practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData brokers, in general, seek to acquire all kinds of information about people in order to add this information to different user profiles; often this also includes extremely sensitive information. Back in 2016, it was revealed that MedBase 200 purportedly sold lists of rape victims—among other list of survivors of domestic abuse and many different illnesses—on its website. The company removed any reference to such a list after they were contacted by the Wall Street Journal reporting on this.(20)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote20sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e This is part of wider practice of websites hosting medical information that share sensitive information about users with third parties, including information about specific conditions, illnesses or treatments. Tim Liberts’ research explains how a “proliferation of third-party requests makes it possible for corporations to assemble dossiers on the health conditions of unwitting users.” (To find out more about how this works, read Tim Liberts’ paper \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://timlibert.me/pdf/Libert-2015-Health_Privacy_on_Web.pdf\"\u003ePrivacy Implications of Health Information Seeking on the Web\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e). Since the Covid pandemic, tele medicine has gained even more popularity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most crucial factors in advertising is knowing whether or not someone is pregnant. Having a baby means that someone’s routines—including where they shop—fall apart and are reshaped for years to come. It is therefore a crucial time for companies to ingrain themselves in the shopping habits of new parents, but especially women, because shopping for essential household items is part of household labor, something women have historically been made responsible for. (Read more here on \"\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://sociology.iresearchnet.com/sociology-of-family/division-of-household-labor/\"\u003ethe Division of Household Labour\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\"). For example, the North American retailer Target has been in this business for at least 20 years. Target made headlines in 2012 when the company knew about a teenager’s pregnancy before her parents.(21)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote21sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Being able to identify pregnant shoppers, companies can make millions in profit (Read more about this in \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html\"\u003eHow Companies Learn Your Secrets\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2014, Janet Vertesi embarked on an experiment and tried to hide her pregnancy from the online advertisement industry; she said it was incredibly difficult and made her feel like a criminal.(22)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote22sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Vertesi only used VPNs to access websites about pregnancy and newborns, she did not purchase any products related to her pregnancy online or with a credit card, instead her and her partner used gift cards. She did not post or message anyone about her pregnancy on social media, nor did she navigate her way to baby stores with Google Maps (to read a full account of her experiment, read \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mashable.com/archive/big-data-pregnancy\"\u003eHow One Woman Hid Her Pregnancy From Big Data\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e). Vertesi, as a white affluent cis-woman living in the United States, with extensive knowledge about how online activity is tracked, could afford to buy gift cards in cash and to plan her pregnancy. For anyone surprised by their pregnancy or living below the poverty line, such luxury is not an option. While Vertesi’s experiment did not have any criminal consequences for her family, this might not be the case for \u003cstrong\u003emarginalised\u003c/strong\u003e people whose everyday activities are much more criminalised and scrutinised than White people’s. After her experience, Vertesi calculated how much more data about a pregnant person is worth compared than data about someone who is not: If an average person’s data is worth USD 0.10, a pregnant person’s data is worth USD 1.50.(23)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote23sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile being targeted by advertisements might seem as a benign consequence of companies having access to period data, it is not entirely. These ads will not only be targeted at you to sell you products but can also inform ads promoting political candidates and ideologies. In addition, pregnancy related ads are pervasive and ‘sticky.’ Once identified as expecting parent and female, you see these ads everywhere—even if the pregnancy ends pre-term. There have been reports of women who miscarried but continued to receive ads reminding them about the baby they lost.\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote24sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(24) This information could impact insurance rates, if this data is routinely collected by employers (in the US) as menstrual data can reveal underlying health conditions or if someone is trying to become pregnant. Pregnancy is still a reason why people are not promoted or hired and the collection of cycle related data by an employer could also harm job prospects.(25)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote25sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt’s not just about ‘choice’\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commercial drive to monetise data about health, reproduction, and menstruation has created a situation in which many institutions and companies aside from period trackers have access to this information and also make it rather easy for governments to acquire this information. The solution to this problem is often framed as one of individual or consumer choice and privacy and the articles discussing the state of surveillance in a post-Roe v Wade US were no different. While informing individuals of what happens to their data and providing them with alternatives is a crucial step towards a solution, a discussion on how race, gender, class and ability limit what choices people can make must also be part of the conversation. Individuals changing their tracking decisions does very little to mitigate the collective harms and downstream effects of this pervasive data collection of peoples reproductive lives. Even if you find the safest period tracker, that does not sell any data, your data could still be used to harm others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, people living in remote or chronically disenfranchised areas in high-income countries depend even more on online health information.\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote26sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(26) This is also the case for accessing reproductive health care, in areas and countries where physical access to a clinic with access to abortion or contraception is impossible. Making sure that it is also safe to access and search for a website that can provide these services or information is crucial, instead of forcing a pregnant person “to engage with a system that actively collects, stores, and sells their online activity data.”(27)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote27sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Marginalised communities do not only depend more on smart phones to navigate their lives, they are also under much more surveillance and policing from the state (To read more about this, here is Simone Browne’s book \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters\"\u003eDark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and Virginia Eubank’s article “\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://prospect.org/power/want-predict-future-surveillance-ask-poor-communities./\"\u003eWant to Predict the Future of Surveillance? Ask Poor Communities\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e”).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndividual changes to online behaviour also do little to address the potential collective harms that result from this pervasive surveillance of people’s reproductive lives. Instead, the reproductive justice (RJ) movement and framework helps us to articulate a way forward as well as a vision.(28)\u003ca href=\"#sdfootnote28sym\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e The framework was developed by Women of Colour activists as critique of the narrow focus on access to abortion and choice by White feminist birth control movements. Instead Reproductive Justice brings into focus how access to reproductive care is shaped by histories of eugenics, sterilization and child removal policies, sexuality, migration status and racialised access to maternity care and contraceptives. Reproductive Justice calls for the right to have a child, to not have a child, to parent children with dignity, the right to control birthing options, to choose sexual partners and to express one’s gender identity and sexuality freely (To read more about reproductive justice and its history, take a look at the website of \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sistersong.net/reproductive-justice\"\u003eSisterSong\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, a non-profit that spearheaded the movement). Because of its comprehensive approach to reproductive rights, this framework also helps build solidarity to other movements that have had to face and resist surveillance—such as People of Colour or immigrants resisting policing—for decades and integrate these lessons into the broader conversations around reproductive rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way we analyse a problem is intimately connected to how we find a solution. The reasons why many solutions to reproductive health surveillance outlined above fall short is because they fail to accurately account for the collective nature of the problem.Thus, it is important to know what happens to your data on an individual level, but any solution that further individualises people navigating data capitalism and reproductive surveillance cannot work. Instead, the way forward lies in collective approaches to both surveillance capitalism and the policing of reproduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-﻿--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWritten by Stefanie Felsberger in November 2022.

The new government, which has only been in power for a short while, is planning to provide free WiFi in public spaces. This means a vast population will now be exposed to commercial and political ads and activities. People and organisations don't have the information that they need to help them safeguard their data and information – particularly as they begin interacting with technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would want to see free and confident communities interacting with technology – without fear of the unknown.

Information is power, and when people have it, they are more powerful and can take control of their lives. We have many challenges, including a lack of awareness and access.

Through this, we have deepened our networks and outreach. We could also engage two ICT interns to help with the localisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, this project posed a challenge for us to devise creative and innovative ways to address the challenges in the digital space, like privacy. For the localisation and media outputs we created, I could travel outside of Nairobi to interview various figures (like politicians, citizens and journalists).

From this short survey, the conversations with attendees, and the interviews with politicians, journalists and citizens, we gained a clearer picture of the digital rights and privacy landscape. This localisation helped us to delve deeper into the topic to see how useful it can be. For our new trainers, who attended our training sessions and are now going to the communities, it allowed the younger generation to see how applicable the lessons are at the community level – to take the materials and the lessons out of the classroom and show how the materials were needed within every community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTT: Why is it essential to continue these collaborations and partnerships?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCN: Since we started engaging in this community work, we have even understood our community more.

For this, JAAKLC’s projects comprised a roadmap of activities for youth and organisations to Share, Learn and Do It Together. These entailed a series of online workshops (Oficinas) and other hands-on activities that were dedicated to recognising participants’ lived experiences and diverse viewpoints around the harms and benefits emerging from the digital ecosystem. The Oficinas are spaces for horizontal dialogue that prototype multi-stakeholder digital governance centred on children, adolescents and youth.

By the time children become young adults, they are already familiar with the idea that their actions, thoughts, beliefs and emotions are data fodder for tech companies; that their circle of friends is hundreds or even thousands of people wide, including strangers and bots; that not having access to technology for a few days or hours can cause symptoms of withdrawal and panic; and that their dream job, or the jobs of their parents, may be carried out by a computer programme by the time they graduate.

And yet, many of the problems persist and some are getting worse, especially in the context of the pandemic and the technological dependency that it creates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the Future Wants was born from the emerging need for critical thinking resources designed for young people, to help them understand the new and existing issues that impact them in their digital lives. What are the biggest concerns impacting young people? How can they be addressed? And how can young people become part of the effort to find solutions for themselves and for future generations?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese questions were the starting point for us at Tactical Tech, a Berlin-based NGO. For the past two decades, we have been working on how to support people to understand, unpack and reflect on technology’s place within society. Over the years we have received regular requests—from parents, educators and others working with young people—to bring our resources into educational environments. Over time, we observed the potential of these projects to give young people critical and thought-provoking tools for understanding the digital world. In 2020, we adapted the Data Detox Kit into a \u003ca href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/families/datadetox-x-youth\" title=\"https\\://datadetoxkit.org/en/families/datadetox-x-youth\"\u003eworkbook for young people,\u003c/a\u003e which has since been translated into 15 languages and has been used by parents, educators and trainers to start conversations with young people around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2021, we were given the opportunity to adapt our exhibition about how technology is shaping society, The Glass Room, for young people, which became the What the Future Wants project. Since it’s inception, The Glass Room has attracted people of all ages. Some of the most curious visitors we have had to The Glass Room were teenagers, maybe dragged in at first by a school trip or parents, but often staying longer than other visitors and asking meaningful and engaging questions. In 2019, a 14-year-old student in the Hague had seen The Glass Room at a conference that she had visited with her father and contact to us asking if she could host it at her school to teach her peers. Since then, the intervention has been hosted at multiple schools, libraries and institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/20221121_WTFW-office-setup-orange-helpers_small.png\" alt=\"Photo of two people wearing all orange hanging up a poster.\" title=\"Two colleagues hanging up one of the What the Future Wants posters; photo courtesy of Daisy Kidd\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eC﻿aption: Two colleagues hanging up one of the What the Future Wants posters; photo courtesy of Daisy Kidd\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we found out, the way youth view technology is complex, and it is not always in line with how ‘Generation Z’ are commonly understood and represented in the media. In this two-part series, we explore how Tactical Tech’s first youth-centered team co-created the public education intervention ‘\u003ca href=\"https://theglassroom.org/en/what-the-future-wants/\" title=\"https\\://theglassroom.org/en/what-the-future-wants/\"\u003eWhat the Future Wants\u003c/a\u003e,’ which was released in Spring 2022.

From the outside, it may seem that young people are the masters of digital technologies, traversing new platforms, trends, and skills with ease and confidence, at a speed that is hard to keep up with. It can be alienating to enter into the world as an outsider and to find a whole generation of people who just know how this stuff works; When did they learn? And who taught them that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, to assume that young people are ‘in the know’ misses an important point: the internet and digital technologies were never designed for children(1)\u003ca href=\"#_ftn1\"\u003e﻿\u003c/a\u003e—in the same way that centuries of human knowledge and understanding led to safe and nurturing environments for children prior to the internet. Their knowledge about this digital space is self-taught and has emerged out of a necessity to take risks, belong and explore like any teenager has the right to do. The only difference is that they are developing in a new territory that is not well mapped out and so the risks and challenges that present themselves are unprecedented, to them, and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his book, ‘New Dark Age’, James Bridle writes: ‘Over the last century, technological acceleration has transformed our planet, our societies, and ourselves, but it has failed to transform our understanding of these things.’(2)\u003ca href=\"#_ftn2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHere Bridle identifies a crucial characteristic of our digital age: it is rooted in uncertainty, human understanding and comprehension has not caught up with the advancement of technologies and the myriad ways that they impact us and our surroundings. This is in part because of the normalisation of technologies. As they fit seamlessly into our everyday lives—the algorithm that decides what song you’ll listen to next, the psychological tuning that makes you stay online for hours, the supply chain that delivers a new iPhone model every year—these systems and mechanisms expertly meet our evolving needs, making it easy to stop questioning them. Even at a time when a simple search query can generate thousands or millions of possible avenues of knowledge, these vast swathes of information can leave us feeling paralyzed(3)\u003ca href=\"#_ftn3\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not fully understand the complexity of what this might mean for the next generations as these types of transformative times are rooted in uncertainty and driven by a constant state of flux. But within the uncertainty, there is an opportunity for new modes of thinking that leans towards the uncertainty and explores it with curiosity. As is written in the introduction of the  ‘Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education\u003ca href=\"#_ftn4\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e’(4), from the Association of College and Research Libraries: ‘Students have a greater role and responsibility in creating new  knowledge, in understanding the contours and the changing dynamics of  the world of information, and in using information, data, and  scholarship ethically.’ \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eCuriosity as a form of critical thinking \u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince its inception, The Glass Room exhibition has provided a space for people to be curious about technology and to explore its impact on the world. It is not a space to provide answers, but rather to pose questions and a forum for discussion. The objects on display are sometimes playful, cheeky, challenging, but more importantly, they tell a story about technology through a unique lens, giving people an entry point into a topic that may have previously seemed impenetrable.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearning from The Glass Room’s breadth of exhibition experiences, we knew that this approach of curiosity as a means for critical thinking works well with young people. The idea for co-creation was taking that concept one step further so that instead of engaging the youth perspective at the point of visiting, the curiosity mindset was built into the initiation and conceptualisation of the project. The curiosity mindset works both ways. We entered into the project with an open mind, ready to learn from the participants, trying to shed our preconceived notions that youth were addicted to their phones and unaware of data collection and targeted advertisements, and open to the possibility that everything we knew before may be turned on its head. We also wanted to encourage a curious and open mindset from the participants, towards their individual perspective on the issues at hand, like algorithmic curation and the role of influencers, but also towards each other, to allow the different cultures, backgrounds, genders, ages to promote learning and connection rather than to deepen differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/20221121_WTFW-topics-identified_small.png\" alt=\"Visual of topics of interest clustered in a web\" title=\"Visual of topics of interest clustered in a web; courtesy of Dominika Knoblochová\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eC﻿aption: Visual of topics of interest clustered in a web; courtesy of Dominika Knoblochová\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn insightful article that sheds light on this concept is from Barabara Fister as part of the Project Information Literacy Series. In article titled ‘Principled Uncertainty: Why Learning to Ask Good Questions Matters More than Finding Answers’\u003ca href=\"#_ftn5\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(5), she poses the question: ‘What can we do as educators to encourage the ethical practice of curiosity, not just for times of uncertainty but as an everyday habit?’ Her answer, to paraphrase, is that we must encourage students to lean into uncertainty rather than to retreat into the familiar. In doing this, students learn the skill of asking open-ended, exploratory questions that have no definitive answer. The learning then is in the pursuit of uncertainty, rather than the adoption of established ideas. As Fister writes: ‘An approach to uncertainty grounded in curiosity invites students to claim their own authority as they formulate their understanding. If we support them when they venture into the unknown and give them the tools  to move forward with integrity, they will be able to explore territories their teachers haven’t already mapped.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eMethods and Principles of Co-Creation\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/collectivewisdom\" title=\"https\\://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/collectivewisdom\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e from MIT’s Co-Creation Studio, the researchers define co-creation as \"an alternative to the single-author vision and involves a  constellation of media production methods, frameworks, and feedback systems.

In these times characterised by uncertainty, we found curiosity to be the best way to encourage young people to engage with difficult questions. Here, in Part 2, we dive into the workshops we conducted and share principles and practices that informed the co-creation process and findings from the workshops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe What the Future Wants co-creation took the form of a workshop that was designed in three parts (explained below). We worked with six partners in the UK, Czech Republic, Ireland, Slovenia, North Macedonia, the Netherlands (and some associated partners in Germany, Turkey, Greece etc.). Approximately 200 young people (between the ages of 13 and 18) participated in around 10 workshops and were selected by our partners, both through existing networks and open calls. Some of the workshops were delivered by Tactical Tech in English, and in collaboration with the partners, and others were delivered independently by the partners, in their local language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe workshop was designed in three parts, three hours each (occasionally shortened where necessary by the partner), which expanded in scale and perspective (individual, group, societal, planetary) as the participants progressed. There were always a facilitator, a note-taker, and a tech supporter. The three parts were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital Natives:\u003c/strong\u003e There are many assumptions about young people and technology, but a lot of the time these assumptions are made from the outside looking in. This session is about young people’s perspective of technology, creating a space for them to share and reflect on experiences of growing up in a digital world, including the good, the bad, and their advice for future generations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital Influence:\u003c/strong\u003e Doom scrolling, profiling, herding—there are many hidden influencers behind screens that shape what individuals see and sometimes how people act. So what can young people do to influence the influencers?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital Ecosystem:\u003c/strong\u003e Technology is not neutral, and it is often intertwined with the society in which it’s built. Looking outwards to the wider web of issues that technology is part of, young people try to understand when technology helps and when it harms, and who gets to make those decisions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the first challenges was understanding the distinction between the different terms surrounding co-creation: ‘co-design’, ‘co-development’, ‘co-production’, which are often interchangeably used. A concern was that we could not claim co-creation if the created outputs were not directly designed and produced by the participants. However, it soon became clear that co-creation can take many forms and does not always result in co-design (the co-creation \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e design of a specific output within a community). Our approach of co-creation was focused on participatory action research, which we then used as the building blocks for creating the content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterlinked with this challenge was the dynamics of powerwhich are a recurring theme in co-creation analysis: ‘who decides the terms of engagement, what media is made and by whom, and why and who benefits from this type of project.\u003ca href=\"#_ftn1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e’(1) As the designers of the workshop, and the creators of the resulting exhibition, we had to be very careful to not set the agenda of the space. How can you encourage open and exploratory questions if you do not have a structure or a starting point? We soon found out that a structure is necessary, and within that structure you need activities that act as starting points for thought and exploration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/20221121_WTFW-favorite-leastfavorite_small.png\" alt=\"Visual of \u0026#x22;most and least favorite things\u0026#x22; as defined by our sample of young people\" title=\"Visual of \\\u0026#x22;most and least favorite things\\\u0026#x22; as defined by our sample of young people; courtesy of Dominika Knoblochová\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCaption: Visual of \"most and least favorite things\" as defined by our sample of young people; courtesy of Dominika Knoblochová\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWarm-up: Most and least favorite things about technology\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example of a simple activity used to warm up the sessions, we gave participants space to share with us how they experience technology by stating 1) their \u003cem\u003efavourite\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003ething about technology\u003c/em\u003e and 2) their \u003cem\u003eleast favourite thing about technology\u003c/em\u003e. They could answer both the questions or just one. The answers that emerged gave us a surface-level insight into the worlds they were inhabiting. Some of the \u003cem\u003efavourite\u003c/em\u003e things were simplelike  ‘sharing’, ‘finding inspiration’, ‘communication’, ‘organisation’, ‘(ability to) simplify tasks’. Others were more profound such as: ‘I don't know where I'd be if I wasn't able to create digital art and things like that’, \u003cem\u003e‘_technology can be a great way for people to get educated, to discover who they really are’, and ‘(my favourite thing) community, finding understanding, the possibility of expression’\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cem\u003e Their _least favourite\u003c/em\u003e aspects of technology revealed the darker side of their day to day experience and included ‘body shaming’, ‘doom scrolling’, ‘when it stops working’, ‘difficult to distinguish fake from reality’ , ‘no accountability’, ‘cyberbullying’ and ‘the most irritating thing for me are the rules that are now in place for the internet. Those are quite old. So yeah, there aren't really any rules for the internet we have right now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite this being a short warm up activity, we came back to the answers time and again to remind ourselves of the where the participants were coming from, how they were defining the issues and what they wanted to protect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eActivity: How others see you\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we used stereotypes or pre-existing narratives, we used them as a provocation. One activity the ‘Stereotype Spectogram’ used common tropes about teens and technology taken from media headlines: ‘Teenagers are addicted to technology’, ‘Technology harms teenagers’ mental health’ and ‘Teenagers are vulnerable to fake news’. This acted as a counter-space, an opportunity for the participants to orient themselves close to or far away from an assumption that the ‘other’ (the media, parents, teachers) had made about them. Using a spectrogram—a scale with ‘agree’ on one end and ‘disagree’ on the other, and everything in between—we asked the participants to place themselves and then explain their position. For example, ‘teenagers are addicted to technology’ resulted in a vibrant discussion that showed the nuanced and often complicated reality that was not reflected in the blanket headline:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘it depends what you mean when you say \"addicted\" I don't spend every single waking moment on my phone and I could survive without it for a while but I would not have fun at all, some people are just dependent on it for dopamine tbh’.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘Probably true, not exclusive or necessarily a problem’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘It's a problem for many, however it is slightly misunderstood, as it is an evolution of socializing.’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘although teenagers are easily influenced by technology, i think that not just teenagers, but adults can get addicted to technology as well.’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘as a teenager myself, a lot of times i find myself looking always for some way to reach technology’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘the question is whether it is addiction due to necessity or \"need\", sometimes technologies provide an escape from unpleasant reality, which can then cause addiction’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘I was out for dinner the other day, and there was a couple out to dinner together.

In particular, it became clear that there was an awareness about the issues that we presented, even if they were over-simplified. Also, although many of the answers on paper lacked clear nuance, when in discussion with the young participants, there was an implicit nuance emerging, which could then be used to adapt the subsequent activities to a level that challenged the group without pushing them in any direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eLessons Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting the expectations, from both the facilitator and participant perspective, is really important and finding a balance between opportunity and capacity is a good starting point. Many opportunities may arise from doing a co-creation process: perhaps there is an unexpectedly high level of engagement and commitment from the participants, or various networks are created as a result of the collaborations, and this creates the opportunity for further collaboration and engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point it’s important to ask: how much time commitment would that require? And do we have the capacity to carry out this additional collaboration in a sustainable and constructive way? To avoid unsustainable or aimless co-creation collaborations: communicate clearly (and early on) what is expected from the participants; decide on a start date and an end date for the co-creation process, or if there is no clear end-date, then state the reason for that; when new opportunities for collaboration present themselves, reflect on if there is enough capacity and time and, if they go ahead, then who is best suited to take them forward. It is very possible that at the point of closure, the participants can continue a form of co-creation or peer-to-peer learning independently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother challenge and learning was the documentation of the workshop. As the workshops were carried out by multiple partners in different formats, iterations and languages, we were not always able to thoroughly document the findings. An advantage of doing the workshops online was that it was much easier to capture the conversations and outcomes from group activities because they were centralised in one place, and on one platform. We also had one note-taker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/20221121_WTFW-laloma-setup.jpeg\" alt=\"What the Future Wants exhibition set-up\" title=\"What the Future Wants exhibition set-up; photo courtesy of La Loma\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eC﻿aption: What the Future Wants exhibition set-up; photo courtesy of La Loma\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the help of six partners, we ran around 10 of these co-creation workshops over the course of approximately 4 months in 2021, engaging approximately 200 young people (between the ages of 13 and 18). After compiling the results of the workshops, we at Tactical Tech analyzed common threads and particular areas of interest that recurred among the young people in these sessions. As it goes with Tactical Tech projects, the next steps involved several rounds of conceptualisation and iterations of our new resources. Some of the What the Future Wants materials matched with and were adapted from The Glass Room resources, while others were new and required research, development, prototyping and testing. Once the materials were finalized, the localization process followed.

We are promoting democratic dialogues, even in difficult times. In our work, we orientate ourselves towards the values of a democratic, liberal society governed by the rule of law.\\\n\\\nVia our digital information and educational programs, we offer spaces to learn, meet up and participate. We use innovative technologies, seize the opportunities of digitalization and, at the same time, reflect on their implications for people and society. Through diverse formats, we enable communication on a worldwide basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor decades, the Goethe-Institut has established and maintained a network of schools committed to promoting the German language and intercultural exchange. This network comprises schools in major cities and remote areas. Therefore, we can reach a wide audience with our programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy enabling young people from smaller countries such as North Macedonia, we have provided those students with the means for their perspectives and ideas to be heard and discussed in a worldwide context. Hopefully, this will encourage many more students worldwide to participate in such programs and to become proactive, engage with their environment and participate in discourses with global impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTT:  \u003cem\u003eCould you share some insights into the collaboration with Tactical Tech?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eG.I.S: The collaboration with TT resulted in the development of WTFW. This exhibit has been an attractive offer for many of our partner schools in Southeast Europe. It provided additional impulses within our efforts to promote information and media literacy among young people in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe partnership between the TT and the Goethe-Instituts in Southeast Europe might be best described as a symbiosis. This joint effort provided a platform for young people and teachers from Europe to learn with and from each other and reflect on current challenges with a global impact. I.e., TT provided innovative means such as co-development workshops in which selected innovation methods were employed. The Goethe-Institut selected highly motivated students and teachers from its extensive partner school network in Southeast Europe and piloted the exhibit WTFW in selected partner schools in Southeast Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, we have linked WTFW with other offers and programs for young people and teachers, such as competitions, open houses at school, German teacher conventions and activities of the German teachers‘ associations in many countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/IMG_8371.jpg\" alt=\"Picture WTFW exhibition\"\u003e*Picture courtesy of Goethe-Institut Skopje\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTT:  \u003cem\u003eWhat essential collaboration results would you like to highlight?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eG.I.S: The co-development workshops for young people enabled an exchange of ideas and views among youth in Southeast-European countries.

Her father claimed her death was ‘\u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-46966009\"\u003ehelped by Instagram\u003c/a\u003e’ and the way the platform’s algorithms pushed graphic self-harm and suicidal material. In the aftermath of his daughter’s suicide, he appealed to the British Government and to social media companies to recognise and respond to the negative influence of social media on young people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The physical isolation of pandemic-related lockdowns has only increased young people’s dependency on social media, amplifying problems of mental health and online harms”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the years between these two fathers telling the stories of their daughters, the physical isolation of pandemic-related lockdowns has only increased young people’s dependency on social media, amplifying problems of mental health and online harms. At the same time, recent internal leaks from Facebook have revealed that \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043194385/whistleblowers-testimony-facebook-instagram\"\u003e13.5% of teen girls still say Instagram makes thoughts of suicide worse\u003c/a\u003e and 17% of teen girls say the same for eating disorders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParents, siblings, grandparents and educators are watching on as the ‘tweens’ and teens in their lives struggle through a complex world of harmful content at the same time as trying to figure out who they are and find their way in the world. Balancing these extremes, whilst trying to give young people the space and freedom to grow independently, is the stuff of many parents’ nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason why former Facebook employee Frances Haugen’s whistleblowing could be game-changing is that it proves Facebook knows that its algorithms are disproportionately harmful, not only to young people but also to society and democracy, yet in Haugen’s words, ‘\u003ca href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/\"\u003eover and over again, [Facebook] has shown it chooses profit over safety. It is subsidizing, it is paying for its profits with our safety\u003c/a\u003e.’ What makes the problem unique for younger generations is that Facebook has an agenda to grow as a business, which means staying popular in a competitive market. Future generations are one of their safest market bets, if (and it’s a big if) they can continue attracting young users. In 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram (for a relatively modest $1 billion dollars), this solved some of their growth problems, but there are always new threats, such as the increasingly popular video sharing platform TikTok, or the chat app Discord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Unfortunately for young users, the content that drives high engagement is often harmful, provoking and tailored to their deepest vulnerabilities”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solution to market dominance is simple: make Instagram into a place where it’s hard to look away and it’s easy to stay. Unfortunately for young users, the content that drives high engagement is often harmful, provoking and tailored to their deepest vulnerabilities. Haugen showed evidence that confirmed what many had suspected: the algorithm Facebook uses to serve content turns ‘engagement’ (what you look at, for how long and how often) into profits through advertising, even if this engagement is harmful. It is this ‘engagement-driven logic’ that amplifies negative spirals and creates content ‘rabbit warrens’ (the more you look, the deeper you go). As she explained in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lx5VmAdZSI\"\u003erecent interview\u003c/a\u003e: ‘What’s super tragic is Facebook’s own research says as these young women begin to consume this eating disorder content, they get more and more depressed and it actually makes them use the app more and so they end up in this feedback cycle where they hate their bodies more and more.’ Haugen showed that this is not only known by the company through its own research, but that it creates a conflict of interest that Facebook has disavowed. If they fix the problem, they will make significantly less money. They have chosen not to: a decision made by a 1 trillion dollar company that Haugen frames as ‘\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/whistleblower-says-facebooks-choices-are-disastrous-for-children-democracy/38F49BD4-614F-4BAB-8D6D-C845063C239D.html\"\u003edisastrous for children and for democracy\u003c/a\u003e’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital technologies, from social media to computer games, have become central to the way young people learn, connect, grow and explore their identities. Indeed, these technologies also have benefits: they can help some young people avoid isolation, seek support with mental health challenges or escape unhealthy home environments. But the idea that these benefits outshine the ills, or that we can leave it up to young people to find a different path through a universe of media algorithmically trained to seek them out and pull them in, ignores the insidious nature of the problem. An overly protective response is wrong: taking technology away from young people is not going to make the problems vanish. Instead, we need to find ways to preserve and grow the digital environment that young people treasure while making it safe, inclusive and nurturing. Recent infrastructure failures such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/technology/facebook-down.html\"\u003ethe blackout that left Facebook and other products such as Instagram and Messenger offline for over 5 hours\u003c/a\u003e also raise important questions about what it means to have such centralised power, knowledge and data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs societies, we have to start talking about technologies as both problem-solving and problem-making. There is a desperate need to hold some of the wealthiest companies in the world to account for an environment that no amount of educated teachers, attentive parents or even the most disciplined and savvy ‘tweens’ can fix. In standing up to Big Tech, there is no need to start from scratch. Whilst the response to the death of Molly Russell has been slow, it has given researchers and advocates in the UK, such as Baroness Beeban Kidron of 5Rights and Sonia Livingstone of LSE, the chance to push for changes in the form of the \u003ca href=\"https://5rightsfoundation.com/our-work/design-of-service/age-appropriate-design-code.html\"\u003eAge Appropriate Design Code\u003c/a\u003e and the long awaited \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-laws-to-keep-children-safe-stop-racial-hate-and-protect-democracy-online-published\"\u003eOnline Safety Bill\u003c/a\u003e, on which Haugen will advise in the coming weeks. The mood is also changing in China, with TikTok announcing a new ‘\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/12/tiktok-acts-on-teen-safety-with-bedtime-block-on-app-alerts\"\u003ebed time\u003c/a\u003e’ feature for 16 and 17 year olds and making changes to their direct messaging features for younger users. Similarly, Tencent has recently moved to curb computer game addiction amongst its younger users, \u003ca href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/8/30/china-forbids-minors-from-gaming-more-than-3-hours-per-week\"\u003erestricting computer games for under 18s to the weekends\u003c/a\u003e, albeit facing criticism for using facial recognition technology to enforce the age-code. With all eyes on Facebook, it has \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58707753\"\u003epaused the development of ‘Instagram Kids’ for 10–12 year olds\u003c/a\u003e, in what it claims is an effort to listen more to concerned policy makers and parents in the wake of the recent revelations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a non-profit working internationally on these issues with young people, we at \u003ca href=\"https://tacticaltech.org/#/\"\u003eTactical Tech\u003c/a\u003e have seen these issues play out first-hand. Our new youth project aims precisely to find out ‘\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/what-the-future-wants-91f7388e0b94\"\u003eWhat the Future Wants\u003c/a\u003e’, while resources such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.datadetoxkit.org/en/families/datadetox-x-youth/\"\u003eData Detox x Youth\u003c/a\u003e, an interactive toolkit for 11- to 16-year-olds, help put young people in control of technologies including social media. We see that young people depend on technology, yet are frustrated with the lack of care that technology companies take for their well-being and mental health. They are not passive users but instead increasingly aware of the problems these technologies create for them, their friends and their younger siblings. The next generation is technology-dependent but also technology-critical. They have led some of the first \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/19/ditch-the-algorithm-generation-students-a-levels-politics\"\u003edemonstrations around the world against carelessly devised algorithms\u003c/a\u003e. Listening to them is important — but being accountable to them is also essential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The next generation is technology-dependent but also technology-critical”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook has abused its position of trust.

The \u003ca href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/misinformation/healthhoax/\"\u003emisinformation it has allowed to propagate around the pandemic\u003c/a\u003e has turned up the heat on its practices. Despite the seemingly disparate nature of these topics — youth, \u003ca href=\"https://ourdataourselves.tacticaltech.org/posts/digital-listening/\"\u003eelections\u003c/a\u003e and healthcare — their root cause is the same. They stem from the attention-based and amplifying nature of the platform, as outlined in the documentary \u003ca href=\"https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/\"\u003eThe Social Dilemma\u003c/a\u003e, and the unethical and astronomical profits these logics produce. Evidence presented by Haugen of the knowingly negative impact these practices have on young people’s lives creates not only the potential for a breakthrough but also a gateway issue that unites users and regulators across political divides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon-profits, educators and parents spend time and effort trying to teach young people how to navigate the digital world. Now it is time to acknowledge: it’s Big Tech that needs to grow up. The moment of tech-enthusiasm has passed and Mark Zuckerberg’s apologies have been stretched over too many acts of neglect. Haugen has given regulators the evidence they need for real change.

On the contrary, living in precarious, shifting and volatile contexts may even increase the value of such tools – acting as an indispensable means of communication for safety, coordination and survival. They are also ‘\u003cstrong\u003egateway devices\u003c/strong\u003e’ – a central means through which almost all other resources can be accessed. As such, they are also devices that can amplify vulnerabilities. These new forms of dependency simultaneously create new sites of struggle; assets which become open to inequitable exposure, control and manipulation. In vulnerable contexts, smartphones are often a lifeline but they can also be a liability because of the way they are currently designed, in that the data traces they produce can also lead to ongoing scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe framing of this study is \u003cstrong\u003eneither for nor against technology use\u003c/strong\u003e, but rather treats it as an inevitable development: technology amplifies existing structural issues rather than creating new problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first part of the study, \u003cstrong\u003eSMART TECHNOLOGIES AND PRECARITY\u003c/strong\u003e, examines how personal technologies are currently utilised by and for communities living in precarious situations. It focuses primarily on people living through \u003cstrong\u003enatural disasters or in crisis\u003c/strong\u003e situations, \u003cstrong\u003erefugees and migrants\u003c/strong\u003e and those living in \u003cstrong\u003epoverty\u003c/strong\u003e. The study focuses on the \u003cstrong\u003eGlobal North\u003c/strong\u003e out of recognition that such precarity is normally studied in the Global South and that there is a distinct lack of synthesis of information on how this impacts communities in other parts of the world, such as North America and Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second part of the study, \u003cstrong\u003eIDENTIFYING THE ISSUES,\u003c/strong\u003e looks across communities and groups and identifies four common themes that are currently under explored when designing for such contexts. These are identified as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edependency\u003c/strong\u003e – in what ways do personal technologies act as an essential lifeline?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eidentity\u003c/strong\u003e –  how are digital identities currently formed through personal devices and \trelated technologies, such as biometrics?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eagency\u003c/strong\u003e – what is the user's experience of control over and choice related to their \tdevices and how does this relate to social and cultural power dynamics?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emultipliers\u003c/strong\u003e – what are the other dimensions, such as changing circumstances over time and scale of solutions, that can exacerbate problems and should impact design\tdecisions?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA user’s \u003cstrong\u003edigital identity\u003c/strong\u003e is complex and multi-faceted. It is often a highly curated connection  (whether the user is aware of this or not) between the \u003cstrong\u003eindividual\u003c/strong\u003e, the \u003cstrong\u003edevice\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eplatforms\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ecommunities\u003c/strong\u003e. The fluidity of a single device in contexts where devices are often shared has repercussions for device ‘ownership’ and goes against ‘smart’ or learning-based models for service delivery based on the principle of optimisation for a single owner. Design assumptions about identity are mainly driven by the desire to facilitate authentication, device or service operation and at times self-expression but overlook the multi-faceted ways that identity works bureaucratically, culturally and for different communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final part of the study, \u003cstrong\u003eREFLECTIONS AND WHERE TO START\u003c/strong\u003e, synthesises the challenges in designing technology for a changing world, in terms of both \u003cstrong\u003edesign process\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003enext steps\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to advance the \u003cstrong\u003edesign process\u003c/strong\u003e, technology needs to be recognised as holding up a \u003cstrong\u003e‘mirror’ to society\u003c/strong\u003e, amplifying and extending existing social, cultural and political trends. Starting from this point it is possible to see design as both problem-solving and problem-making. As technology designers and engineers become the \u003cstrong\u003earchitects of the new built environment\u003c/strong\u003e, more needs to be done to ensure they have the skills, knowledge and tools they need to make the right decisions and that they have appropriate methods that help them design for the \u003cstrong\u003e‘real’ world not just the ‘ideal’ world\u003c/strong\u003e. Having more \u003cstrong\u003evaried design teams\u003c/strong\u003e with different lived experiences may by its very nature lead to shifts in processes or product outcomes, or perhaps even in the identification of the core problems that need to be solved. Society, industry and the institutions that regulate and control them are only at the beginning of this journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of \u003cstrong\u003enext steps\u003c/strong\u003e, use of personal devices in these contexts desperately requires more research in order to develop a \u003cstrong\u003edeeper understanding of needs\u003c/strong\u003e, investment of time and energy to ensure that we have design models and methods that work for ‘\u003cstrong\u003esociety as user\u003c/strong\u003e’ not just individual users. There is also a need for \u003cstrong\u003eincreased capacity building\u003c/strong\u003e for governments, regulators, funders and civil society groups to help them engage in the political, social and cultural challenges brought by the widespread integration of and dependency on such technologies. \u003cstrong\u003eCross-sectoral collaboration\u003c/strong\u003e is necessary in order to understand how technologies are tested across sectors, for example how technology for tracking the movement of migrants can be used for tracking human mobility in public health outbreaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe widespread use of mobile phone technologies to track and trace the spread and control of \u003cstrong\u003eCOVID-19\u003c/strong\u003e has shown how essential personal devices are for mitigating, solving and supporting global problems for a vast range of communities. Mass tracking and analysis of mobile phone data under lockdown has shown who can afford to stay at home and who cannot, amplifying existing inequalities. Now, more than ever, we need to understand how smartphone technology works not only as a \u003cstrong\u003elifeline\u003c/strong\u003e but also as a \u003cstrong\u003emagnifier\u003c/strong\u003e, and the trade-offs it forces us to make in a changing world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRead the full paper \u003ca href=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/smartphone-as-lifeline.pdf\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eby Stephanie Hankey, Cade Diehm, Rose Regina Lawrence and Marek Tuszynski\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIllustration: Ann Kiernan\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"title":"The Organiser’s Activity Book","description":"The Organiser’s Activity Book is a new self-learning resource from Tactical Tech’s Data and Activism project.

Nous sommes confronté⋅e⋅s à des compromis entre ce qui semble efficace et rapide et ce qui semble éthique et sûr. Dans les deux cas, nous devons faire face aux conséquences politiques et sociales à long terme -- renoncer à nos valeurs ou investir dans une technologie équitable. Chaque fois qu'un événement nous oblige à repenser le type de technologie disponible et la façon dont nous devrions l'utiliser, Tactical Tech est interrogé⋅e par ses partenaires et par ses activités d'engagement public telles que la \u003ca href=\"https://theglassroom.org/\"\u003eGlass Room\u003c/a\u003e : quels sont les outils que nous recommandons qui sont conviviaux, fonctionnels et qui ne mettront pas en danger notre sécurité, notre vie privée et notre sûreté ? En d'autres termes, on nous demande souvent des alternatives aux outils les plus couramment utilisés. De nombreuses personnes nous demandent de recommander des outils de communication, de collaboration et de mise en réseau conçus en tenant compte des droits des utilisatrices, utilisateurs et des principes de protection de la vie privée -- et qui fonctionnent sans les grands complexes de stockage de données que sont Facebook, Alphabet ou autres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCes questions sont devenues beaucoup plus fréquentes au cours de l'actuelle pandémie de coronavirus. On s'attend à ce que nous, ou d'autres entités travaillant sur la technologie et la société, recommandions l'ultime boîte à outils infaillible d'outils prêts à l'emploi. Les personnes veulent connaître la liste des outils qu'elles, ils devraient installer et elles, ils ne voudront peut-être pas répondre aux questions sur les raisons de les utiliser ou non, qui sont en réalité difficiles. La situation est urgente et les personnes sont préoccupées par les choix qu'elles, ils font, c'est pourquoi nous finissons souvent par suggérer des alternatives faciles à utiliser qui demandent moins d'investissement en compétences, en ressources et en temps. Cependant ce n'est pas -- et ne devrait pas être -- si simple. Nous avons compilé ici un mélange d'explications, de conseils et de recommandations sur les technologies permettant de travailler ensemble à distance. Vous y trouverez également de nombreuses idées de lectures complémentaires et les endroits où les trouver. Le texte est organisé en quatre parties.

Malheureusement, aujourd'hui, la majorité des outils dont nous sommes toutes et tous dépendant⋅e⋅s sont fabriqués par des entreprises dont l'état d'esprit est exclusivement celui de la Silicon Valley et dont le modèle commercial repose sur l'extraction de données personnelles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSi vous n'avez pas le temps de lire le livre \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" de Shoshana Zuboff, lisez au moins l'\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook\"\u003einterview\u003c/a\u003e(en).

L'approche de nos projets \"\u003ca href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/fr/home/\"\u003eData Detox Kit\u003c/a\u003e\"(fr) et \"\u003ca href=\"https://theglassroom.org/fr/desinformation\"\u003eGlass Room\u003c/a\u003e\"(fr) répond au besoin de solutions rapides. Nous sommes conscient⋅e⋅s du fait que de nombreux individus, groupes et organisations ne sont pas en mesure d'apporter des changements significatifs ou drastiques à la technologie qu'elles, ils utilisent. Cela peut être dû à un manque de ressources, de compétences, de connaissances, d'aide ou de financement. Notre approche avec ces projets est de les rencontrer là où elles, ils se trouvent et d'introduire des changements progressifs et des améliorations étape par étape dans des environnements connus. Cette approche ne résout pas les problèmes, cependant elle en réduit certains. Elle met les utilisatrices, utilisateurs sur la bonne voie pour mieux comprendre la technologie elle-même et leur donne la confiance nécessaire pour faire plus de choix et prendre des mesures plus ambitieuses à l'avenir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa deuxième approche consiste à changer de mentalité, ou « douleur à court terme, gain à long terme ». La technologie durable, sûre et indépendante exige un changement beaucoup plus important dans notre façon de penser la technologie. Elle exige des investissements et des ressources beaucoup plus importants. Indépendamment du fait que nous, chez Tactical Tech, nous promouvons les solutions libres et l'auto-hébergement, nous savons que ce n'est pas la voie à suivre pour de nombreux groupes avec lesquels nous travaillons. Plus concrètement, cela exige des ressources importantes : la technologie peut être gratuite, mais la location ou l'achat de serveurs ne l'est pas. Leur maintenance n'est pas non plus gratuite : vous ne pouvez pas compter sur des bénévoles et cela exige une mise à jour constante de vos compétences et de vos ressources. Cela exige également une formation et un cadre financier : si vous voulez soutenir des organisations indépendantes, sûres, résistantes et durables, vous devez penser à la technologie autant qu'à la gestion, aux finances ou aux ressources humaines. Ce sont des outils de travail essentiels et ils nécessitent de sérieux investissements à long terme. Cet investissement doit s'adresser non seulement aux utilisatrices, utilisateurs, mais aussi aux fabricants. Si certains de ces outils présentent des problèmes de convivialité, des défauts de conception ou une courbe d'apprentissage abrupte, c'est parce qu'ils sont gérés par de petites équipes spécialisées disposant de ressources extrêmement limitées. Cette deuxième approche exige non seulement un changement de mentalité, et aussi un changement systémique et technopolitique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCes deux modèles décrivent la situation dans laquelle nous nous trouvons : soit nous devons manger du fast food, soit nous devons cultiver notre propre nourriture. Le premier modèle est pratique mais pas très sain ; le second est meilleur pour nous néanmoins il demande beaucoup de temps et de compétences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePouvez-vous construire une société démocratique, équitable et ouverte avec des outils fermés et propriétaires ? Vous êtes-vous trouvé⋅e dans un espace public qui fonctionne bien et qui appartient à une entreprise ? Avez-vous fait l'expérience d'un bien commun fonctionnel, entouré de caméras de surveillance et de capteurs ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa plupart des outils que nous utilisons aujourd'hui ne sont pas seulement basés sur le cloud mais ont également été créés pour être aussi simples que possible (\u003cem\u003esans friction\u003c/em\u003e) et pour attirer le plus grand nombre d’utilisatrices, d'utilisateurs (\u003cem\u003esocial\u003c/em\u003e), qui en retour deviendraient dépendant⋅e⋅s de leurs plateformes (\u003cem\u003ebasé sur l'utilisat⋅rice⋅eur\u003c/em\u003e). Ces plateformes sont offertes gratuitement (\u003cem\u003evous êtes le produit\u003c/em\u003e) et elles transforment leur base d’utilisatrices, d'utilisateurs en une base de données (\u003cem\u003eprofilage\u003c/em\u003e) qui peut ensuite être monétisée (par le biais de publicité ciblée ou équivalent). Nous cliquons sur « J'accepte » pour leur donner accès à notre comportement (\u003cem\u003emétadonnées\u003c/em\u003e) et faciliter les cookies, les balises, les scripts et autres, tout est possible, y compris les empreintes de navigation (\u003cem\u003etrackers\u003c/em\u003e). Une solution consiste à installer un bloqueur de publicité, mais les mêmes données sont utilisées pour façonner l'ensemble de votre expérience : bulles de filtre, bots personnalisés, coups de pouce incitatif, \u003ca href=\"https://tacticaltech.org/#/news/data-detox-dark-patterns\"\u003edark partterns\u003c/a\u003e, etc. Votre expérience de ces technologies est loin d'être ouverte et gratuite ; elle est également loin d'être de haute qualité. Nous connaissons maintenant ces aspects de l'industrie des réseaux de données, pourtant nous utilisons quand même les outils parce que tout le monde les utilise et qu'il est si facile de s'y fier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUne autre réflexion qui mérite d'être évoquée ici concerne la dépendance. Toute rupture ou perturbation de ces services centralisés utilisés par des milliards de personnes, des entreprises et même des gouvernements, entraînerait un problème de proportions égales. Une dépendance à grande échelle crée une responsabilité à grande échelle. Nous avons déjà eu un aperçu de ce que cela peut signifier lorsque des services comme Facebook/WhatsApp ou Google Docs disparaissent pendant de courtes périodes. Et s'ils disparaissent pendant des semaines ? Ce sont des outils comme les autres -- ils ont leurs limites et leur masse critique. La question est de savoir quand ils vont atteindre leurs limites et avec quelles conséquences. Il ne s'agit pas de savoir si, mais quand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa dernière réflexion porte sur les vulnérabilités. Est-ce vraiment une bonne idée que le Premier ministre d'un pays comme le Royaume-Uni dirige le gouvernement depuis son pays en utilisant un outil propriétaire non testé et peu sûr comme Zoom ? Ces défis ne concernent pas seulement la société civile. Les défenseurs des droits humain et les journalistes d'investigation ne sont pas les seuls à avoir besoin de confidentialité et d'outils fiables pour préserver leur intégrité et leur sécurité ; il en va de même pour les gouvernements, les entreprises, les institutions publiques et les particuliers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSans frottement équivaut à sans effort. Dans le monde réel, les frictions sont nécessaires pour comprendre les systèmes et faire des choix, comme dans les relations personnelles. De même, lorsque nous supprimons les frictions dans la conception technologique, les choses deviennent plus faciles à utiliser, cependant nous perdons notre capacité cognitive à comprendre leur fonctionnement et les modèles commerciaux qui les sous-tendent. Cette approche, combinée à la \"gammification\" de nos interactions (systèmes de récompense, défilement sans fin, boucles de rétroaction positive), nous rend dépendant⋅e⋅s d'outils dont les pratiques nous déplaisent parfois. Le \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\"\u003escandale de Facebook et Cambridge Analytica\u003c/a\u003e en est un exemple.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePour en savoir plus sur ce nouveau paradigme des influenceurs, vous pouvez consulter notre projet \"Données et politique\" - en particulier le rapport sur les \"\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tacticaltech.org/#/news/personal-data-political-persuasion\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePersonal Data: Political Persuasion\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\" (Données personnelles : Persuasion politique).\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEt si vous êtes intéressé⋅e par le financement de ces solutions technologiques commerciales, commencez ici : \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/27/is-venture-capital-worth-the-risk\"\u003eIs Venture Capital Worth the Risk?

Elle crée également un environnement propice à la promotion et au recours à des modes de fonctionnement autoritaires -- et la technologie est très utile à cet égard. La technologie qui permet la surveillance est toujours promue au nom de la sécurité et de la sûreté (nationales). Cela n'est pas nouveau et a déjà été exercé dans d'autres types de crises ou en réponse à des problèmes -- tels que le terrorisme, le contrôle des frontières ou le mouvement des réfugié⋅e⋅s. Nous pouvons déjà voir combien de ces mêmes technologies -- telles que le suivi par géolocalisation des téléphones portables -- sont utilisées en réponse à la crise COVID-19.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eConsultez \u003ca href=\"https://www.medianama.com/2020/03/223-surveillance-coronavirus/\"\u003eici\u003c/a\u003e (en) la liste des mesures prises pour mettre sous surveillance les personnes mises en quarantaine dans différents pays.

L'idée est de vous donner un cadre qui vous aidera à trouver les solutions adaptées à vos besoins, aussi à vos capacités et à vos ressources. Si vous n'êtes pas d'accord, vous pouvez toujours faire vos propres choix, qui pourraient en fait être beaucoup plus viables pour vous -- et votre réponse pourrait être G Suite ou WhatsApp (Facebook) -- cela dépend de ce qui est le plus important pour vous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNous essayons toujours de nous en tenir à ces sept principes lorsqu'il s'agit des outils eux-mêmes. Ils sont tels que :\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOpen source\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFiable (vérifiable)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMature (stable, avec une communauté d'utilisatrices, d'utilisateurs active et une communauté de développeuses, développeurs réceptive)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConvivialité\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMulti-langue avec aide à la localisation (pour que vous puissiez trouver votre propre langue ou la localiser)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMulti-plateforme (Mac, Windows, Linux, Android)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDisposer d'une documentation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSi vous pensez que nous n'abordons pas ici deux questions importantes -- à savoir les données et le chiffrement -- vous avez raison ; cela vient plus loin dans le texte. En outre, en ce qui concerne le point 1, nous préférons utiliser des logiciels libres à code source ouvert (FLOSS) -- nous nous en tiendrons toutefois au terme \"open source\" tout au long du texte pour éviter toute confusion sur l'aspect \"libre\", car il est souvent confondu avec les logiciels gratuits, les logiciels gratuits ou les solutions logicielles propriétaires gratuites, ce qu'il n'est pas.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLes sept principes ci-dessus peuvent être résumés dans une brève déclaration : pour nous, \u003cstrong\u003ela confiance est le principe directeur\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParce que les logiciels sont faits de code, nous voulons faire confiance à ce code et non aux promesses de celles et ceux qui veulent que nous l'utilisions. Si vous avez une boîte noire (logiciel propriétaire) à côté d'une boîte ouverte (logiciel à source ouverte), choisissez toujours la boîte ouverte. Recommander ou faire confiance à une boîte noire est risqué, car il faut prendre toutes les promesses des fabricant⋅e⋅s au pied de la lettre. En dehors de l'entreprise, les autres ne savent pas et ne peuvent pas savoir s'il s'agit d'un bon ou d'un mauvais code. En fait, nous ne savons pratiquement rien sur les données collectées, où vont nos données, etc. Cela ne signifie pas que l'open source par défaut est meilleur ; en fait, il s'agit simplement d'un code écrit par certaines personnes avec toute une série de risques. Cependant parce qu'il est ouvert, il peut être vérifié -- et c'est important. L'autre chose qui compte à propos de l'open source est qu'elle est livrée avec une licence non propriétaire, permettant aux utilisatrices, utilisateurs d'agir en autonomie, de la partager avec d'autres et de la modifier. Et c'est gratuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalheureusement, l'open source a été trop utilisée pour décrire les logiciels, ce qui rend la situation confuse. Certains composants peuvent être à code source ouvert (par exemple, une application que vous pouvez exécuter sur votre appareil) mais le logiciel qui s'exécute sur le serveur de l'entreprise (cloud) peut être propriétaire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuant aux autres principes, en temps de crise, il y a un désir sans précédent de solutions rapides. Ce ne sont pas seulement les utilisatrices, utilisateurs qui les recherchent, ce sont aussi les investisseuses, investisseurs, les entreprises, les gouvernements, etc. C'est aussi une période où beaucoup d'innovations peuvent se produire. Or comme pour tout le reste en temps de crise, c'est souvent chaotique. Les demandes axées sur la résolution de problèmes à court terme déclenchent des solutions qui introduisent de nouveaux problèmes. Il reste peu de temps pour tester, déboguer et même comprendre ce qui se passe. C'est pourquoi, pour nous, la maturité est importante dans le choix des outils que nous voulons utiliser.

Il existe de grands nuages (boîte noire), soit des serveurs qui sont à votre disposition pour faire fonctionner des services (par exemple Amazon, Microsoft), soit des plateformes qui stockent et traitent vos données (par exemple Facebook, Alphabet ou leurs filiales telles que Instagram, Google Maps, Zoom, Slack et des centaines d'autres). Il existe également des nuages de taille moyenne. Ils sont gérés par des opérateurs relativement petits qui peuvent disposer de leur propre infrastructure et qui vous fournissent des services spécialisés (open box, par exemple Greenhost) ou qui peuvent vous fournir les éléments dont vous avez besoin, cependant qui dépendent également des grands nuages mentionnés ci-dessus. Enfin, il existe également des petits nuages, c'est-à-dire des services en nuage auto-hébergés (la plupart du temps des services en boîte ouverte sous votre propre contrôle) gérés par des institutions, des organisations ou des particuliers elles et eux-mêmes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTous les nuages ne sont pas égaux. Chez Tactical Tech, nous préférons les petits et moyens nuages qui respectent les utilisatrices, les utilisateurs et leurs droits et libertés, et ceux qui reposent sur des solutions en source ouverte avec des modèles commerciaux qui ne sont pas basés sur la monétisation des données personnelles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLe concept de « nuage » est très important : il permet à plusieurs clients (ordinateurs portables, téléphones mobiles) de faire plus que ce qu'ils pourraient faire autrement. Votre navigateur, ou une application sur votre téléphone, devient une interface vers un système plus puissant et plus performant, qui vous fournit des outils et du contenu à distance, à condition que vous soyez suffisamment privilégié⋅e⋅s pour disposer d'un accès Internet rapide et bon marché. L'avantage est que vos données sont plus mobiles : vous pouvez y accéder à partir de différents appareils et endroits et les partager facilement avec d'autres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCe n'est pas le seul modèle disponible. De nombreuses activités qui reposent sur le cloud, par exemple le partage de fichiers, peuvent également être traitées par nos appareils et nous pouvons faire beaucoup de choses directement les un⋅e⋅s avec les autres -- c'est ce qu'on appelle \u003cstrong\u003ele modèle peer to peer ou P2P\u003c/strong\u003e. Bit Torrent, une technologie de partage de fichiers, en est un exemple. De nombreuses sociétés de jeux informatiques utilisent le P2P pour distribuer leurs jeux (comme Diablo III, StarCraft II et World of Warcraft). D'autres exemples sont Tor, l'outil d'anonymisation, et Bitcoin, la crypto-monnaie, qui sont probablement les réseaux peer to peer les plus connus aujourd'hui. Les utilisatrices, utilisateurs ont besoin de systèmes décentralisés, distribués, permettant l'interopérabilité et la communication entre homologues (peer to peer) et ne nécessitant pas d'infrastructure centrale lourde et coûteuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLe fait est que toutes celles, tous ceux qui possèdent un ordinateur portable ou un smartphone de nos jours dépendent d'une manière ou d'une autre des services en ligne. Certaines personnes font presque tout dans le (grand) nuage. La fourniture de services et d'informatique en nuage est une source de revenus considérable pour presque toutes les grandes entreprises de données, dont Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft et Netflix, pour ne citer que les plus importantes. Mais des entreprises comme Uber et Zoom suivent également le même modèle. Elles gèrent l'infrastructure et collectent toutes les données possibles. Ce que nous obtenons, c'est l'interface avec cette infrastructure centralisée, avec l'avantage d'outils efficaces. Ce que nous perdons, c'est toutes les données qui entrent dans ce système accumulé et agrégé. Ce à quoi nous renonçons également, et c'est peut-être plus important pour la société, c'est la connaissance ainsi agrégée.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrivilégier le minimalisme des données. En utilisant et en choisissant des services basés sur le cloud, recherchez des services et des outils qui collectent le minimum de données possible, qui partagent le minimum de données nécessaires et qui stockent le minimum de données essentielles. Si vous devez fournir des services à d'autres personnes, comme l'organisation d'événements, la tenue de listes de diffusion ou la réalisation d'enquêtes, si vous n'avez pas à collecter de données, ne le faites pas. Si vous le faites, faites preuve de transparence, minimisez-les autant que possible et supprimez ce dont vous n'avez plus besoin.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSi vous n'avez pas le choix et que vous devez vous fier à Facebook et à d'autres plateformes populaires, le \u003ca href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/fr/home/\"\u003eData Detox Kit\u003c/a\u003e (fr) de Tactical Tech propose un ensemble d'étapes faciles pour vous aider à mieux contrôler votre vie privée numérique, votre sécurité et votre bien-être numérique tout en utilisant vos appareils et plateformes préférés.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePour nous, aider les utilisatrices, utilisateurs à prendre conscience de ce qui se passe derrière l'écran de leurs appareils, quelles que soient les plateformes qu'ils utilisent, est un petit pas, mais très important, pour faire des choix éclairés et comprendre les politiques qui se cachent derrière la technologie et son impact sur leur vie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSi vous utilisez ou recommandez Slack, Zoom ou d'autres outils en ligne pour travailler, apprendre ou maintenir des services de santé, veuillez lire d'abord ceci : \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/what-you-should-know-about-online-tools-during-covid-19-crisis\"\u003eWhat You Should Know About Online Tools During the COVID-19 Crisis\u003c/a\u003e (en ; es) (Ce que vous devez savoir sur les outils en ligne pendant la crise COVID-19)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEt si vous êtes un⋅e militant⋅e qui s'appuie sur les médias sociaux, lisez notre page \u003ca href=\"https://ourdataourselves.tacticaltech.org/posts/23_guide_social_media/\"\u003eActivisme sur les médias sociaux : Guide démêlé\u003c/a\u003e (en)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eL'importance du chiffrement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSi nous recommandons des outils en ligne ou dans le nuage basés sur les principes que nous avons mentionnés ci-dessus, nous devons également les évaluer sur des éléments qui garantissent la confidentialité et la sécurité de nos communications, tels que le chiffrement de bout en bout. Qu'est-ce que le chiffrement de bout en bout ? Il s'agit d'une technologie qui vous permet d'envoyer quelque chose à une autre personne, et que seul⋅e⋅s vous et elle peuvent lire. Les autres personnes qui peuvent voir cette communication ne la voient que comme un charabia -- cependant, elles (généralement le fournisseur de services) peuvent voir les métadonnées, c'est-à-dire qu'elles peuvent toujours voir que vous envoyez des messages, d'où, quand, combien de fois et à qui. Elles ne peuvent tout simplement pas voir le contenu de ce que vous dites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe nombreux services différents utilisent le chiffrement. Celui-ci nous permet de faire des choses simples en toute sécurité et confidentialité en ligne, comme les opérations bancaires ou les achats en ligne. Certains services de communication promettent aux utilisatrices, utilisateurs un chiffrement de bout en bout, alors qu'en fait, ils ne chiffrent que les échanges entre vous et leur serveur, puis entre eux et votre interlocutrice, interlocuteur. Cela permet de sécuriser vos conversations, or le fournisseur de services a accès à toutes les informations en clair. En ce sens, vos informations ne sont chiffrées que lorsqu'elles sont en mouvement, mais elles ne sont pas techniquement protégées d'être accessibles, traitées, analysées ou réutilisées par le fournisseur de services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIl existe d'autres limites au chiffrement de bout en bout. Parfois, les entreprises prétendent l'utiliser, cependant il est difficile pour une utilisatrice, un utilisateur ordinaire de le vérifier. Certains services sont \"\u003ca href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt_in\"\u003eopt-in\u003c/a\u003e\" et d'autres ne le sont que partiellement. Par exemple, le chiffrement peut ne fonctionner qu'à une certaine échelle d'utilisation, comme entre deux participant⋅e⋅s seulement, mais pas pour les salons de discussion de groupe. Ou encore, il peut fonctionner correctement lorsque vous utilisez un service d'une manière unique -- par exemple, votre iPhone -- puis ne pas fonctionner pour d'autres services connexes, par exemple la sauvegarde. Il est alors difficile pour les utilisatrices, utilisateurs de naviguer et de prendre de bonnes décisions sans vérifier tous les détails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSi vous souhaitez savoir ce qu'est le chiffrement de bout en bout ou comment il fonctionne, veuillez lire cette \u003ca href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/fr/module/communiquer-avec-autrui\"\u003eexplication accessible et vraiment utile de l'EFF\u003c/a\u003e (fr).\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSi nous parlons de chiffrement, l'autre problème est qu'en temps de crise en particulier, il devient un point central du débat. Chaque fois que nous nous penchons sur la criminalité, la désinformation ou la fraude en ligne, il semble que le chiffrement fasse partie de la discussion, certains, certaines affirmant qu'il permet ces méfaits et ces activités malveillantes. Il y a certainement des corrélations -- la causalité est beaucoup plus complexe. Si un⋅e terroriste décide d'utiliser une voiture comme arme, par exemple, cela ne fait pas de toutes les voitures une arme du terrorisme. Selon la même logique, si le chiffrement est utilisé pour planifier une activité criminelle, cela ne signifie pas que le chiffrement lui-même est criminel. Un bon exemple est WhatsApp, qui chiffre les conversations des utilisatrices, utilisateurs et cependant collecte les métadonnées (comme expliqué ci-dessus). WhatsApp compte plus de 2 milliards d’utilisatrices, utilisateurs et le fait que leurs conversations ne puissent pas être lues, même par WhatsApp, a ses avantages. Le chiffrement permet aux conversations (je n'ai peut-être rien à cacher, or cela ne signifie pas non plus que j'ai quelque chose à vous montrer) et (pour l'instant) il les protège de la publicité ciblée en fonction de ce dont elles, ils parlent (bien que Facebook cherche toujours à monétiser sa base d’utilisatrices, utilisateurs, donc qui sait ce qui va changer à l'avenir).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePour certain⋅e⋅s sceptiques du chiffrement, c'est le principal vecteur de désinformation. Parce que le chiffrement permet le secret, certaines personnes pensent qu'il fournit un canal sûr pour organiser des actes répréhensibles -- et c'est certainement vrai, le chiffrement permet la confidentialité, la sécurité \u003cem\u003eet\u003c/em\u003e le secret. L'un ne va pas sans l'autre, et il est exclusivement entre les mains des utilisatrices, utilisateurs. Les véritables enjeux sont plus nuancés. La dimension d'échelle du canal chiffré tient en le fait qu'il permet de faire circuler des informations malveillantes. Les actions de ses utilisatrices, utilisateurs sont le support qui permet à la désinformation banale de proliférer rapidement et de manière exponentielle. Le chiffrement est en effet également utilisé par des réseaux criminels et d'autres délinquant⋅e⋅s, cependant il est fort probable qu'ils, elles ne feront que prendre un autre outil si le chiffrement est supprimé de WhatsApp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePourtant tout cela ne signifie pas que le chiffrement est nocif. Comme dans de nombreux cas, la technologie n'est ni bonne ni mauvaise ici : \u003cstrong\u003ela technologie est stupide et aussi jamais neutre\u003c/strong\u003e. Tout dépend des intentions de celles et ceux qui l'utilisent. Il se peut que le problème, ici encore, soit le modèle commercial.

Vous pouvez l'utiliser avec plus de personnes, vous devez alors faire confiance à l'hôte. Cela n'est pas unique à Jitsi Meet : le chiffrement de bout en bout des appels vidéo pour plusieurs utilisatrices, utilisateurs est limité à un très petit nombre de participant⋅e⋅s pour la majorité des outils disponibles ; cela peut être atténué en utilisant le chiffrement du transport des données et en faisant confiance au serveur au milieu.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eD'après notre expérience, Jitsi Meet fonctionne bien avec de petits groupes -- nous dirions jusqu'à huit à dix personnes -- avec plus le parcours devient un difficile.

Premièrement, tout le monde n'est pas égal sur Internet. La personne avec laquelle vous communiquez peut avoir un accès très limité à l'internet, ou bien celui-ci peut être très coûteux ou encore avoir des limites sur la quantité de transferts de données (le transfert vidéo mange beaucoup de données). Deuxièmement, elle peut aussi utiliser des dispositifs obsolètes ou peu sûrs, ou les partager avec d'autres. Troisièmement, leur environnement technologique, social, économique et politique peut être beaucoup moins fiable, sûr et prévisible. Le fait qu'ils, elles communiquent avec vous peut exposer leurs vulnérabilités, leur statut, leurs points de vue, leurs croyances ou leurs associations, ce qui peut les exposer à de graves risques. Ce n'est pas parce que vous pouvez faire quelque chose que les autres doivent vous suivre. Réfléchissez bien aux choix que vous faites pour les autres lorsque vous les invitez à participer à vos processus.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePour plus de détails, voir le rapport de recherche de Tactical Tech \"\u003ca href=\"https://tacticaltech.org/#/news/smartphone-as-lifeline\"\u003eChanging Worlds\u003c/a\u003e\" (en).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSi vous êtes en ligne, vous êtes suivi⋅e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvant même que vous n'allumiez vos applications préférées, vous êtes suivi. C'est ainsi que la téléphonie mobile doit fonctionner pour vous fournir des services. La téléphonie mobile fonctionne parce que nos téléphones sont constamment localisés par les fournisseurs de téléphonie mobile pour obtenir le meilleur signal, afin que nous puissions passer des appels et obtenir des données lorsque nous nous déplaçons. Ces informations sont suffisantes pour déterminer assez précisément nos déplacements, et ces données peuvent être transformées en données comportementales -- par exemple, où nous vivons, comment nous nous déplaçons, avec qui nous interagissons et ce qui nous intéresse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTactical Tech a réalisé il y a quelque temps une \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/160231751\"\u003eanimation\u003c/a\u003e illustrant tout ce que l'on peut apprendre des données acquises à partir d'un téléphone portable\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePourquoi est-ce important maintenant ? Nous voyons que dans de nombreux endroits, les entreprises de télécommunications utilisent et partagent des données mobiles avec les gouvernements et les institutions publiques pour suivre, surveiller et isoler la propagation du coronavirus, aussi pour voir quelle proportion de la population reste à la maison et pour s'assurer qu'elle y reste. Des nouvelles quotidiennes apparaissent à ce sujet dans le monde entier, notamment en \u003ca href=\"https://apps.derstandard.at/privacywall/story/2000115828957/kronenzeitungmobilfunker-liefert-bewegungsprofile-aller-handynutzer-der-regierung\"\u003eAutriche\u003c/a\u003e (de) et en \u003ca href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/coronavirus-they-want-to-use-your-location-data-to-fight-pandemic-thats-a-big-privacy-issue/\"\u003eAllemagne\u003c/a\u003e (en). Dans d'autres endroits, les gouvernements s'associent à des sociétés de renseignement, comme Palantir au Royaume-Uni. Ou ils utilisent des \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/surveillance-company-nso-supplying-data-analysis-to-stop-virus\"\u003eoutils produits par des sociétés telles que le NSO\u003c/a\u003e (en), connu pour son soutien à la collecte de renseignements et à l'espionnage par piratage envers des citoyennes et citoyens\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\"\u003eLe scandale de Cambridge Analytica\u003c/a\u003e (en) a révélé l'utilisation de la publicité ciblée et du profilage psychologique, deux méthodes qui étaient déjà utilisées depuis des années, néanmoins connues uniquement de celles et ceux qui en tirent profit. L'utilisation de données (géolocalisation) en grand volume pour suivre et contenir la propagation de coronavirus va, espérons-le, révéler quelque chose qui a toujours existé, à savoir que les téléphones portables sont des traqueurs. Ces données deviennent encore plus riches et plus précises si votre téléphone est un peu plus intelligent et permet la localisation de réseaux et le GPS.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDans le contexte du partage de données volumineuses, on entend souvent un autre mot magique : « anonymisation ». L'anonymisation est un processus qui détache les données de l'identité de l'utilisatrice, de l'utilisateur. Cela signifie que vous pouvez être en mesure de voir mes données -- par exemple, ce que j'aime manger ou à quelle fréquence je prends un taxi -- pour autant vous ne savez pas qui je suis. Malheureusement, l'anonymisation est très proche du concept de « sécurité ». Il s'agit dans les deux cas d'aspirations plutôt que d'états permanents réalisables. La sécurité est un processus continu qui doit être maintenu. L'anonymisation est un processus qui offre une certaine protection aux utilisatrices, utilisateurs et aux entreprises qui collectent leurs données. Cependant, le processus peut souvent être annulé si vous avez suffisamment de patience et de données à portée de main. Il existe de nombreux exemples d'ensembles de données communiqués par des services au public, puis désanonymisés et réidentifiés à des individus, révélant souvent des informations compromettantes à leur sujet (voir \u003ca href=\"https://monitor.firefox.com/\"\u003eici\u003c/a\u003e (fr)).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTactical Tech a réalisé une\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/195500135\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ecourte animation\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003esur le fonctionnement de l'anonymisation.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLes problèmes collectifs nécessitent des actions collectives\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa société civile ne dispose pas d'outils solides et respectueux de la vie privée, car pratiquement personne n'investit dans de tels outils -- ni les investisseurs, ni les gouvernements, ni les bailleurs de fonds privés. Paradoxalement, ces acteurs sont souvent les premiers à demander des recommandations et à se plaindre que les outils recommandés ne répondent pas vraiment à leurs attentes -- et ils ne le feront jamais. La technologie est fondamentale pour les individus, les organisations, la société civile au sens large et la sphère publique. Il est vraiment tragique que nous devions compter sur le seul secteur privé, dont le principal outil de décision est le profit. Actuellement, les principaux outils et plateformes sont principalement basés aux États-Unis. Les principales alternatives proviennent de pays comme la Chine (par exemple, TikTok, qui a désormais une portée mondiale) ou la Russie (Yandex, le moteur de recherche régional). La plupart de ces solutions sont basées sur l'exploitation de données personnelles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa technologie coûte de l'argent -- beaucoup d'argent -- non seulement pour créer des outils, surtout pour les entretenir. L'infrastructure nécessaire à leur fonctionnement est encore plus coûteuse. Et plus crucial encore sont les compétences nécessaires à celles, ceux qui créent et administrent ces outils. Si nous voulons que les organisations s'appuient sur des solutions durables et fiables, elles doivent avoir accès au savoir-faire et aux ressources nécessaires, soit pour héberger elles-mêmes les services dont elles ont besoin, soit pour disposer d'autres options qui fonctionnent à l'échelle. Actuellement, aucune de ces deux options n'est en place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIl ne suffit plus de rejoindre le camp de ceux qui n'utilisent pas Facebook, évitent Google ou même installent des ROM (systèmes d'exploitation) personnalisées sur leurs mobiles, ou s'appuient exclusivement sur l'open source (pour être honnête, certains d'entre nous chez Tactical Tech le font aussi). Ce qu'il faut, c'est une action collective -- non pas une action qui tente de revenir à l'époque où les données étaient un actif d'un milliard de dollars, plutôt aller de l'avant. C'est un moment important pour apprendre ce qui ne va pas avec les choix optionnels dont nous disposons et quel est l'impact de ces pratiques sur différents secteurs (comme l'éducation), sur les communautés qui en ont besoin et sur la société en général. C'est un excellent moment pour réévaluer les outils dont nous avons besoin et les raisons pour lesquelles nous en avons besoin, et pour innover dans la création d'alternatives viables qui fonctionnent dans l'intérêt public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLa lutte contre une pandémie nécessite la collaboration, la solidarité et la mise en réseau. Elle exige une science saine et une excellente prise de décision. Toutes ces réponses doivent être accompagnées par la technologie -- ou exploitées par elle. Il est temps de décider de quel côté vous êtes.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa plus grande partie de ce texte se concentre sur les besoins des individus et des petits groupes et sur les technologies qu'ils et elles peuvent utiliser à une époque où le travail à distance est de plus en plus répandu. Il est important de mentionner que les problèmes que nous avons exposés dans ce texte sont encore plus importants lorsqu'il s'agit d'institutions et d'organisations plus importantes : fondations, universités, écoles, hôpitaux, organismes d'aide, réseaux formels et informels. Toutes ces grandes entités doivent également passer du jour au lendemain à des modes de fonctionnement virtuels. Elles prennent maintenant des décisions cruciales concernant les plateformes, les fournisseurs, les services, les outils et les applications sans avoir le temps de se former à leur utilisation et souvent sans financement supplémentaire. Elles doivent examiner les ressources dont elles disposent, leurs obligations, leurs attentes et leurs exigences. Il est extrêmement difficile de fonctionner dans de telles conditions. Et là encore, l'efficacité est importante, souvent plus que d'autres choses. Sur le plan institutionnel -- autant que personnel -- il est difficile d'imaginer un monde dans lequel, par exemple, Microsoft, Google et Zoom ne facilitent pas les écoles. Ces services rendent sans aucun doute plus efficace, moins cher et plus facile le passage des écoles au virtuel, or ils entraînent les mêmes problèmes que ceux dont nous avons discuté à propos des plates-formes à grande échelle et des compromis. Pour imaginer des technologies alternatives, il faut imaginer une technopolitique alternative (par exemple, qui collecte les données, comment et qui en bénéficie ?) et des modèles commerciaux alternatifs -- que se passerait-il si les contributions fiscales étaient utilisées pour créer des technologies d'intérêt public ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSi vous voulez en savoir plus sur les problèmes liés aux technocorrections (technofixes), réessayez cet essai : \u003ca href=\"https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/efficiency_and_madness.pdf\"\u003eEfficiency and Madness\u003c/a\u003e (en).\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNous ne faisons pas du travail à distance ou de l'enseignement à distance comme si tout allait bien.

Toutefois, cela pourrait aussi être un moment de clarté, de reconnaissance, de solidarité et de collaboration, de sorte que lorsque nous sortirons de ce moment, il y aura beaucoup à faire.

We are facing trade-offs between what seems efficient and quick versus what seems ethical and safe. In either case, we have to deal with the long-term political and social consequences — giving up on our values or investing in equitable tech. Whenever something happens that forces us to rethink what kind of technology is available and how we should use it, Tactical Tech is asked by its partners and through its public engagement activities such as the \u003ca href=\"https://theglassroom.org\"\u003eGlass Room\u003c/a\u003e: what tools do we recommend that are user-friendly, functional and won’t risk our safety, privacy and security? In other words, we are often asked for alternatives to the most commonly used tools. Many people ask us to recommend communication, collaboration and networking tools that are designed with users’ rights and privacy principles as their primary design choice – and that work without the big data-hoarding complexes of Facebook, Alphabet or the like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese questions have become much more frequent during the current coronavirus pandemic. The expectation is that we, or other entities working with technology and society, will recommend the ultimate infallible toolbox of ready-to-use tools. People want the list of tools they should install and they might not want to work through the questions about why to use them or why not, which are in truth difficult. There is an urgency to the situation and people are concerned about the choices they make, so we often end up suggesting some easy-to-use alternatives that demand less investment in skills, resources and time. But it’s not – and shouldn’t be – that simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we’ve compiled a mixture of explanations, advice and recommendations about technologies for working together remotely.

Responding to the need for quick fixes is the approach of our \u003ca href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/home\"\u003eData Detox Kit\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://theglassroom.org/\"\u003eGlass Room\u003c/a\u003e projects, where we appreciate the fact that many individuals, groups and organisations are not in a position to make significant or drastic shifts in the technology they are using. This can be due to a lack of resources, skills, knowledge, help or funding. Our approach with these projects is to meet them where they are and introduce incremental changes and step-by-step improvements within known environments. This approach does not solve problems but it does reduce some of them. It gets users on track to gain a better understanding of technology itself and builds confidence to make more choices and take more ambitious steps in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second approach is about a change of mindset, or ‘short-term pain, long-term gain‘. This is much harder to implement and even talking about it is not straightforward.Sustainable, secure, independent tech requires a much more significant shift in how we think about technology. It demands much more significant investment and resources, and regardless of the fact that we at Tactical Tech promote free and open-source solutions and self-hosting, we know this is not the way to go for many groups we work with. More practically, it requires significant resources: the tech might be free but renting servers or buying them is not. Maintaining them it is not free either: you cannot rely on volunteers and it requires constantly updating your skills and resources. It also requires training and a funding environment: if you want to support independent, secure, resilient and sustainable organisations you have to think about technology as much as you think about management or finances or human resources. These are essential tools for work and they need serious long-term investment. That investment should be addressed not only to the users but also to the makers. The reason some of these tools have usability issues, flaws in designs or a steep learning curve is because they are run by small, dedicated teams with extremely limited resources. This second approach not only requires a change of mindset but also a systemic, techno-political shift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two models describe the situation we are in: either we have to eat fast food or grow our own. The former is convenient but not very healthy; the latter is better for us but is time and skill intensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you build a democratic, equitable and open society with closed and proprietary tools? Have you been in a well functioning public space owned by a corporation? Have you experienced a functioning commons cordoned with surveillance cameras and sensors?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the tools we use these days are not only cloud-based but were also created to be as simple as possible (\u003cem\u003efrictionless\u003c/em\u003e) and to attract the largest possible number of users (\u003cem\u003esocial\u003c/em\u003e), who would in return become dependent on their platforms (\u003cem\u003euser-based\u003c/em\u003e). These platforms are offered for free (you are the product) and they turn their user base into a data base (\u003cem\u003eprofiling\u003c/em\u003e) that can then be monetised (through targeted advertising or similar). We click ‘I agree’ to give them access to our behaviour (\u003cem\u003emetadata\u003c/em\u003e) and facilitate cookies, beacons, scripts and what-not – anything goes, including fingerprinting browsers (\u003cem\u003etrackers\u003c/em\u003e). One solution is to install an ad blocker, but the same data is used to shape your entire experience: filter bubbles, tailored bots, nudges, \u003ca href=\"https://tacticaltech.org/#/news/data-detox-dark-patterns\"\u003edark patterns\u003c/a\u003e and so on. Your experience of these technologies is far from being open and free; it is also far from high-quality. By now we know these things about the data dragnet industry but we use the tools anyway because everyone else does and they are so easy to rely upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thought worth bringing up here is about dependency. Any collapse or disruption to these centralised services used by billions of people, companies and even governments, would cause a problem of equal proportions. Large-scale dependency creates large-scale liability. We have already seen glimpses of what this can mean when services like Facebook/WhatsApp or Google Docs go down for short periods of time. What if they went down for weeks? These are tools like any other – they have their limits and their critical mass. The question is when they are going to reach their limits and with what consequences. It is not about if but when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thought is about vulnerabilities. Is it really a good idea for the Prime Minister of a country like the UK to be running the government from home using an untested, insecure proprietary tool like Zoom? These challenges are not only for civil society. It is not only human rights defenders and investigative journalists that need confidentiality and trusted tools to maintain their integrity and safety; it applies equally to governments, businesses, public institutions and individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrictionless is equal to effortless. In the real world, friction is necessary for understanding systems and making choices, like in personal relationships. Similarly, when we remove friction in technological design, things becomes easier to use, but we lose our cognitive ability to understand how they work and what business models are behind them. This approach, combined with the ‘gamification’ of our interactions (reward schemes, endless scrolls, positive feedback loops), makes us dependent on tools with practices we may otherwise disagree with. The scandal with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica is a case in point here.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor more about this new influencers' paradigm you can check our Data and Politics project – in particular the report on\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://tacticaltech.org/#/news/personal-data-political-persuasion\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePersonal Data: Political Persuasion\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd if you are interested how these commercial tech solutions are funded, start here:\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/27/is-venture-capital-worth-the-risk\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Is Venture Capital Worth the Risk?

It also creates a fertile environment for promoting and relying on authoritarian modes of operation – and technology comes in very handy here. Technology that enables surveillance is always promoted in the name of (national) security and safety. This is not new and has already been exercised in other types of crises or in response to problems – such as terrorism, border control or movement of refugees. We can already see how many of the same technologies – such as mobile phone geolocation tracking – are being used in response to the COVID-19 crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCheck the list of steps taken to put quarantined people under surveillance in different countries\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.medianama.com/2020/03/223-surveillance-coronavirus/%20\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ehere\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cem\u003eOr if you prefer The New York Times read\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ethis\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.

The idea is to give you a framework that will help you find the right solutions for your needs but also fit to your capacities and resources. If you disagree, you can always make your own choices, which in fact might be much more viable for you – and your answer might be G Suite or WhatsApp (Facebook) – it depends on what’s more important for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe always try to stick to these 7 principles when it comes to the tools themselves. They have to be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOpen source\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrusted (audited)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMature (stable, with an active user-based community and responsive developer community)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUser-friendly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMulti-language with localisation support (so you can find your own language or localise it)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMulti-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux, Android)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHave available documentation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you think we are not addressing two important issues here – namely,  data and encryption – you are right; that comes later in the text. Also, in regards to point 1, we prefer using Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) – we will however stick to the term 'open source' throughout the text to avoid confusion about the 'free' aspect, as it is often confused with freeware, freemium or free of charge proprietary software solutions, which it is not.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 7 principles above can be summarised in a short statement. For us, \u003cstrong\u003etrust is the guiding principle\u003c/strong\u003e. Because software is made out of code, we want to trust this code and not the promises of those who want us to use it. If you have a black box (proprietary software) next to an open box (open source software) to chose from, always go with the open box. Recommending or trusting a black box is risky, due to the fact that one has to take all the promises of the makers at face value. Outside of the company, others do not and cannot know if it is good or bad code. In fact, we know practically nothing about what data is collected, where our data goes, and so on. This does not mean that open source by default is better; in fact, it is also just some code written by some people with a range of risks attached. But because it is open it can be verified – and that matters. The other thing that matters about open source is that it comes with a non-proprietary license, allowing users to act independently, to share it with others and to change it. And it is free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, open source has been overused as a description of software and this makes it confusing. Some components might be open source (say, an app you can run on your device) but the software running on the company server (cloud) might be proprietary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the other principles, in times of crisis there is an unprecedented hunger for quick solutions. It is not only users who are looking for them but also investors, companies, governments, etc. This is also a time when a lot of innovations can occur. But as with everything else during a crisis, it is often chaotic. Demands focused on solving short-term problems trigger solutions that introduce new problems. There is little time to test, debug and even understand what is happening. This is why, for us, maturity is important when choosing tools we want to use. It might sound conservative – and maybe it is – but it is also responsible and rational because when we make decisions too quickly there are real, longer-term consequences. In addition, they are often experienced by those who need the most protection and care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor an in-depth list and explanation of these principles, please visit\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://securityinabox.org/en/about\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eour Security In-A-Box project\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, which Tactical Tech started and then co-developed with Frontline Defenders.

There are big (black box) clouds – either servers that are available to you for running services (e.g. Amazon, Microsoft) or platforms that store and process your data (e.g. Facebook, Alphabet or their subsidiaries such as Instagram, Google Maps, Zoom, Slack and hundreds more). There are medium-sized clouds, too. These are run by relatively small operators that might have their own infrastructure but provide you with specialised services (open box, eg. Greenhost) or might provide you with the things you need, but also rely on the above-mentioned big clouds. And, lastly there are also small clouds – self-hosted cloud services (mostly open-box ones under your own control) run by institutions, organisations or individuals themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all clouds are equal. At Tactical Tech we prefer small and medium-sized ones that respect users and their rights and freedoms, and those that rely on open source solutions with business models that are not based on monetising personal data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The cloud' as a concept is very important – it allows multiple clients (laptops, mobile phones) to do more than they could otherwise. Your browser, or an app on your phone, becomes an interface to a more powerful and capable system, serving you tools and content from a remote location – assuming you are privileged enough to have cheap and fast internet. The advantage is that your data is more mobile – you can access it from different devices and locations and you can share it with others easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not the only model available. Many activities that rely on the cloud, for example file sharing, can also be handled by our devices and we can do many things directly with each other – this is what is called the \u003cstrong\u003epeer to peer or P2P model\u003c/strong\u003e. Bit Torrent, a file sharing technology, is one example. Many computer game companies use P2P to distribute their games (such as Diablo III, StarCraft II and World of Warcraft). Other examples are Tor, the anonymisation tool, and Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency, which are probably the most known peer to peer-based networks today. Users need systems that are decentralised, distributed, allow interoperability and peer to peer communication and do not require heavy and expensive central infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact is that everybody who has a laptop or smart phone these days relies in some way or another on cloud services. Some people do almost everything in the (big) cloud. Providing cloud computing and services is a massive source of income for almost all of the major data-driven companies, including Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix, to name the biggest. But companies like Uber and Zoom also follow the same model. They run the infrastructure and they collect all the data possible. What we get is the interface to that centralised infrastructure, with the benefit of efficient tools. What we lose is all the data that goes in to that accumulated and aggregated system. What we also give up, perhaps more importantly for society, is the aggregated knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFavour data minimalism. In using and choosing cloud-based services, look for services and tools that collect the minimum data possible, that share the minimum data necessary and that store the minimum essential data. If you have to provide services to others, such as organising events, keeping mailing lists or running surveys, if you don’t have to collect data, don’t do it. If you do, be transparent about it, minimise it as much as possible and delete what you no longer need.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you have no choice and you have to rely on Facebook and other popular platforms, Tactical Tech’s \u003ca href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/home\"\u003eData Detox Kit\u003c/a\u003e offers a set of easy steps to help you take better control of your digital privacy, security, and well-being while still using your favourite devices and platforms.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor us, helping users become being aware of what’s happening behind the screen of their devices, regardless of what platforms they’re using, is a small but very important step in making informed choices and understanding the politics behind technology and its impact on their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you are using or recommending Slack, Zoom or other online tools for working, learning or maintaining health services, please read this first: \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/what-you-should-know-about-online-tools-during-covid-19-crisis\"\u003e\"What You Should Know About Online Tools During the COVID-19 Crisis\" \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if you are an activist relying on social media read our \u003ca href=\"https://ourdataourselves.tacticaltech.org/posts/23_guide_social_media/\"\u003eActivism on Social Media: Curated Guide\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe importance of encryption\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhilst we recommend online or cloud-based tools based on the principles we mentioned above, we also have to evaluate them on things that guarantee the confidentiality and safety of our communication, such as end-to-end encryption. What is end-to-end encryption? It is a technology that enables you to send something to another person, and only you and them can read it. Others who may see this communication only see it as mumbo-jumbo – however, they (usually the service provider) can see the metadata, meaning they can still see that you are sending messages, from where, when, how often and to whom. They just can’t see the content of what you are saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLots of different services use encryption. It enables us to do simple things securely and confidentially online, such as online banking or shopping. Some communication services promise users end-to-end encryption, when in fact they only encrypt things between you and their server and then again between them and whomever you are talking to. This makes it secure when you are speaking, but the service provider has access to all the information unencrypted. In this sense, your information is only encrypted when it is in motion but it is not technically protected if from access, processing, analysis or being reused by the service provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some other limits to end-to-end encryption. Sometimes companies claim they are using it, but it is hard for an average user to verify this. Some services are opt-in and others are only partial. For example, encryption might only work to certain scale of use, e.g. only between two participants, but not for group chats. Or, it may work well when you use a service one way – for example, your iPhone – but then not work for other related services, for example back-up. This makes it tricky for users to navigate and make good decisions without checking all the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you want to explore what end-to-end encryption is or how it works, please read\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/communicating-others%20\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ethis accessible and really useful explanation from EFF\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we are talking about encryption, the other issue with it is that at times of crisis in particular, it becomes a focal point of debate. Whenever we look into online crime, misinformation or fraud, it seems encryption is part of the discussion, with some claiming that it enables these wrongdoings and malicious activities. There is certainly some correlation – but causation is much more complex. If a terrorist decides to use a car as a weapon, for example, that does not make all cars a weapon of terrorism. By the same logic, if encryption is used to plan a criminal activity, it does not mean encryption itself is criminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good example is WhatsApp, which encrypts users' conversations but collects the metadata (as explained above). WhatsApp has over 2 billion users and the fact that their conversations cannot be read, even by WhatsApp, has its strengths. Encryption enables conversations (I may have nothing to hide, but that doesn’t mean I have something to show you, either) and (for now) it protects them from targeted advertising based on what they are talking about (although Facebook is always looking to monetise their user base, so who knows what will change in the future).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some encryption sceptics, it is the primary enabler of misinformation. Because encryption enables secrecy, some people believe that it provides a secure channel to organise wrongdoing – and that is definitely true, encryption enables  confidentiality, security \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e secrecy. You cannot have one without the other – and it is exclusively in the hands of users. The real challenges are more nuanced. The scale of the encrypted channel is what allows malicious disinformation to be circulated. The actions of its users are what allow banal misinformation to proliferate rapidly and exponentially. Encryption is indeed also used by criminal rings and other offenders, but they will most likely simply pick up another tool if encryption is removed from WhatsApp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all that does not mean encryption is bad. As in many cases, tech is neither good nor bad here: \u003cstrong\u003etechnology is stupid but never neutral\u003c/strong\u003e. It all depends what the intentions are of those who use it. It could be that the problem here again is the business model. By choosing these tools as our primary communication tools at scale, we support monolithic centralised systems that operate at a planetary scale, causing planetary problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere are other aspects to this issue like the cross-platform spread of misinformation (despite encryption) and the responsibility of users.

You can use it with more people, but you have to trust the host. This is not unique to Jitsi Meet: the end-to-end encrypting of video calls for multiple users is limited to a very small number of participants for majority of tools available; this can be mitigated by using transport encryption and trusting the server in the middle.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom our experience Jitsi Meet does well with small groups – we would say up to eight to ten people – then things get a bit bumpy.

That said,  we are using Jitsi a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you require an environment resembling a class room set-up, with whiteboard, many rooms, chat, voice and video enabled as well as screen, presentation and external video sharing - we would recommend using \u003ca href=\"https://bigbluebutton.org/\"\u003eBigBlueButton\u003c/a\u003e - this is especially viable for those who can self host.

At the very least, think about using different services, or, if you can, break up your work into different pieces. Can you live stream some parts of it? Can you run a webinar, and pre-record some of the content? Can you change the scale of some of the interactive parts of your work to multiple smaller groups or use multiple channels (e.g., one channel for collaborative documents and another for audio chat only, such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.mumble.info/\"\u003eMumble\u003c/a\u003e)?

The person you are communicating with might have very limited access to the internet, or it might be very expensive or have limits on the amount of data transfers (video transfer eats lots of data). Second, they might also be using outdated or insecure devices, or they might be sharing them with others. Third, their technological, social, economic and political environment might be much less reliable, safe and predictable. The fact that they are communicating with you might be exposing their vulnerabilities, status, views, beliefs or associations, which might put them at serious risk.

This is enough information to fairly precisely determine our whereabouts, and this data can be turned into behavioural data – for example where we live, how we commute, who we interact with and what we are interested in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTactical Tech made\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/160231751\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ean animation\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003esome time ago illustrating how much one could learn from data acquired from a mobile phone.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is it important now? We see that in many places telecommunications companies are using and sharing mobile data  with governments and public institutions to track, monitor and isolate the spread of the coronavirus, but also in order to see how much of the population is staying at home and to ensure they stay there. Daily news stories are emerging about this across the globe, such as \u003ca href=\"https://apps.derstandard.at/privacywall/story/2000115828957/kronenzeitungmobilfunker-liefert-bewegungsprofile-aller-handynutzer-der-regierung\"\u003eAustria\u003c/a\u003e and  \u003ca href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/coronavirus-they-want-to-use-your-location-data-to-fight-pandemic-thats-a-big-privacy-issue/\"\u003eGermany\u003c/a\u003e. In other places governments are partnering with intelligence companies, such as Palantir in the \u003ca href=\"https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/03/27/fantastic-cia-funded-palantir-is-helping-the-nhs-plan-its-coronavirus-response/\"\u003eUK\u003c/a\u003e. Or they use \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/surveillance-company-nso-supplying-data-analysis-to-stop-virus\"\u003etools produced by such companies as NSO\u003c/a\u003e, known for supporting intelligence gathering and hacking of citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed the use of targeted advertising and psychological profiling – two methods that had been already been employed for years, but known only by those making money from them. The use of big (geolocation) data for tracking and containing the spread of coronavirus will hopefully expose something that again has always been there – that mobile phones are trackers. This data gets even richer and more precise if your phone is a bit smarter and enables network locations and GPS.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the context of sharing big data, we often hear another magical word: 'anonymisation'. Anonymisation is a process that detaches data from the identity of the user. This means that you may be able to see my data – for example, what I like to eat or how often I take a taxi – but you do not know who I am. Unfortunately, anonymisation is very similar to the concept of 'security'. Both are aspirations rather than achievable permanent states. Security is an ongoing process that needs to be maintained. Anonymisation is a process that gives users and the companies who collect their data some protection. However, the process can often be undone if you have enough patience and enough data sets at hand. There are many examples of data sets being released from services into the public and then being deanonymised and reidentified to individuals, often revealing compromising information about them (see \u003ca href=\"https://monitor.firefox.com/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTactical Tech made a\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/195500135\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eshort animation\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003eabout how anonymisation works.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCollective problems require collective actions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCivil society does not have robust,  privacy respecting tools because hardly anybody invests in such tools – neither investors, nor governments nor private funders. Paradoxically, these actors are often the first to ask for recommendations and complain that the tools recommended don’t really satisfy their expectations – and they never will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnology is fundamental to individuals, organisations, civil society at large and the public sphere. It is truly tragic that we have to rely on the private sector alone, one whose primary decision-making tool is profit. Currently, the mainstream tools and platforms are predominantly US-based. The main alternatives come from countries like China (e.g. TikTok, now with a global reach) or Russia (Yandex, the regional search engine). Most of these solutions are based on the exploitation of personal data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnology costs money – lots of money – not only to create tools but more importantly to maintain them. The infrastructure required for them to function is even more expensive. And even more critical are the skills needed by those who create and administer these tools. If we want organisations to rely on durable and reliable solutions, they need to have access to the know-how and the resources to either self host services they need or to have alternative options that work at scale. Currently, neither is in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is no longer enough to join the camp of those who don’t use Facebook, avoid Google or even install custom ROMs (operating systems) on their mobiles, or rely exclusively on open source (to be honest, some of us at Tactical Tech do that, too). What is necessary is collective action – not one that tries to go back to the old days before data became a billion-dollar asset, but rather to go forward. This is an important time to learn what is wrong with the options we have and what impact these practices have on different sectors (like education), on communities who need them and on society at large. It is an excellent time to re-evaluate the tools we need and the reasons we need them and to be innovative about what creating viable alternatives that work in the public interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFighting a pandemic requires collaboration, solidarity and networking. It requires good science and excellent decision making. All these responses need to be supported by technology – or exploited by it. It is time to decide which side you are on.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of this text focuses on individual and small group needs and technologies that they can use in a time of heightened remote working. It is important to mention that the problems we have outlined in this text are even bigger when it comes to larger institutions and organisations: foundations, universities, schools, hospitals, aid agencies, formal and informal networks. All of these larger entities also have to move overnight to virtual modes of operation. They are now making crucial decisions about platforms, providers, services, tools and apps without the proper time for training how to use them and often without extra funding. They have to look at the resources they have, their obligations, expectations and demands. It is extremely difficult to operate under such conditions. And again efficiency matters, often more than other things. Institutionally – as much as personally – it is hard to imagine a world in which, for example Microsoft, Google and Zoom are not facilitating schools. These services definitely make it more efficient, cheaper and easier for schools to become virtual, but they bring with them all the same problems we have been discussing about large-scale platforms and the trade-offs. Imagining alternative technologies requires imagining alternative techno-politics (such as who gathers data, how, and who benefits from it) and alternative business models – what would happen if tax contributions were used to create public good technologies?.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you want to read more about the problems with technofixes, try this essay,\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/efficiency_and_madness.pdf\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eEfficiency And Madness\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are not doing remote work or remote education as if everything is fine.

This abrupt slow-down, lock-down and separation will likely go on for a long time in different places. We don’t yet know how bad it will become. In some cases, it will enable authoritarian regimes and aligned businesses to grab more power. However, it could also be a moment of clarity, recognition, solidarity and collaboration, so that when we emerge from this moment there will be plenty do to.

One contextualisation partner, for example, might find evidence of five major methodologies in their home country, while another might find evidence of the technologies described in every chapter. Note that all formal political processes are eligible for analysis here, allowing partners to document the application of these technologies in elections and political issue campaigns (e.g., referendums, recalls, inner-party campaigning).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCo-Creation Partnerships\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCo-Creation Partnerships are the most involved and resource-intensive of the four possible partnerships. For this reason, preference will be given to strong localisation partners and to partners in compelling circumstances (for example, those in places with an upcoming election in which a technology that uses personal data is in widespread use). Co-Creation Partnerships will be comprised of partners, Tactical Tech’s Data \u0026#x26; Politics team, and depending on the technology at hand, a technical specialist. Some examples might include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA local group could partner with Tactical Tech’s Data \u0026#x26; Politics team and a mobile app security engineer to explore how a popular presidential candidate’s app is collecting and using the personal data of its users (relating to chapter 6 of the report).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA partner might work with the Data \u0026#x26; Politics team and a digital marketing expert to study political ads on search engines (chapter 10).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn environmental rights group could work with Tactical Tech and a web developer to track a government agency or candidate’s experiments with slogans regarding climate change and public transportation services (chapter 5).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese partnerships aim to investigate important questions and collaboratively develop strategies for election monitoring as part of a larger effort to help local groups across the world examine and monitor digital interference in their own elections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWho?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are looking to partner with organisations on one or more of the four different types of partnerships outlined above.

This is matched by increased surveillance and more arrests and legal prosecution based on internet behaviour. Current debates largely treat digital technologies as one of the many pillars of restrictive methods on the side of governments and non-state actors – while largely ignoring how digital technologies are intertwined in all our social, political and economic interactions. Whether through smartphones, computer devices, smart cities, CCTV cameras or government surveillance, technology provides the infrastructure with which governments and third parties attempt to limit political participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe escalation of attacks on civil society organisations (CSOs) and on the spaces for political and civic participation, in parallel with a resurgence of populist politics and parties and their rise to power in some countries, calls for concern. The attacks are no longer confined to what were traditionally known as countries with compromised democratic systems. Nowadays, shrinking spaces are not only affecting local NGOs and CSOs but also international organisations such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. The trend can be seen in denials of funding as much as in the government-sponsored spread of stigmatising misinformation (as seen in the case of US reproductive rights groups like Planned Parenthood), restrictive laws and police incursions (such as raids of NGOs in Hungary) and the criminalisation and confiscation of resources (exemplified by the Italian government’s impounding of a migrant-rescue boat belonging to a Spanish NGO).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe increasingly normalised surveillance and analysis of troves of citizens’ data by governments and the private sector also contributes to the shrinking space of civil society. Data about individuals and communities is collected from sources ranging from social media activity to Smart City and IoT technology and CCTV cameras. The ways that members of CSOs communicate with others, express their views, organise events, mobilise support, build solidarity, and process, create, store and exchange information are all inevitably part of the digital sphere. Consequently, data-driven practices – either by governments or corporations – significantly impact activists, CSOs and social movements. To ensure their safety and wellbeing, activists need to navigate a trade-off between visibility and anonymity due to risks and threats from state and non-state actors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the surveillance and monitoring of data and activities by governments and private companies, activists and CSOs have experienced an escalation in covert attacks using malware, phishing and spyware. In Egypt for example, CSOs were the primary targets of an organised phishing attack. Such attacks are not restricted to so-called “countries of risk” but can extend globally. Amnesty International was the target of Operation Kingphish, which involved the creation of a fake social media persona by an unknown actor, who, according to a report by a senior technologist at Amnesty, used phishing attacks to gain access to “dozens of journalists, human rights defenders, trade unions and labour rights activists, many of whom are seemingly involved in the issue of migrants’ rights in Qatar and Nepal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this landscape as the backdrop, this paper focuses on the threats, risks and implications of shrinking civic space from a digital perspective. We examine how tech platforms, data collection, surveillance and other digital means can threaten, restrict or curtail the work of CSOs and the spaces for political and civic participation. It is important to understand this landscape because many CSOs depend on tech platforms and tools for their work, including their outreach and research. Furthermore, their activities generate data that is collected and can be used to undermine their causes, and in certain cases, affect individuals’ wellbeing and personal safety. Though technology and digital platforms have helped CSOs expand their efforts, they have also expanded the area of risk and led to an increase in the invasiveness of the methods used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ourdataourselves.tacticaltech.org/posts/shrinking-civil-space-a-digital-perspective/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVisit Project Website\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"title":"Tactical Tech's New Look","description":"In March 2019, Tactical Tech celebrated its 16 year anniversary.

As well as being a time to honour and reflect on all the work we've done with our current and former team over the past decade and a half, it was a great opportunity to look ahead to the future, and plan how the organisation moves forward. This involved taking a long hard look at what was working and what wasn't and making the organisation future-ready for the next stage of our work, which meant dealing with three interlinking things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all the strategy. We reviewed the changing context around us and our experience in the field, and figured out how we can have the most impact in the coming years. In reviewing our theory of change we have decided to continue to work with our traditional audiences, but also reach out to a much broader group of engaged technology users. We firmly believe in giving these users the knowledge they need to navigate the challenges technology brings and to make informed decisions. In the coming years we will also try out new approaches that we believe will address some of the most pressing challenges related to technology, human rights and civil liberties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, we carried out an internal review of how the organisation is run, to respond to the increase in team size and the shift in strategy. One of the decisions that came out of that was the change in name from 'The Tactical Technology Collective' to 'Tactical Tech'. This change is a significant one. It was made to better reflect the internal arrangement of the organisation, that has a much larger team and has to run in a more structured way than when the organisation first began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thirdly, we wanted to focus on how we communicate our work and our impact to our audiences so that they are in a better position to understand what we do, why we’re doing it, and how they can use our resources and access our events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat has not changed is our determination and passion for the work we do and our commitment to investigate and mitigate the impact of technology on society. Tactical Tech's new branding and website are just the start of a wider range of changes we will be making and we look forward to sharing and engaging with you on these as they are made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRead on to learn more about the new branding and new website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe New Brand\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start with, we thought about the visual identity of the organisation. The first logo was commissioned back in 2003, and then we kept it like that for 15 years. So it was time for a change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlongside Paul Belford Ltd., a small branding agency based in London, we worked on developing a concept around the relationship between humans and technology. This idea was drawn from our strategy, looking at the traces and impact of digital technologies on society and individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis concept grew into the idea of an analogue glitch, the sort of imperfections that would appear from bad scans, photocopies, paper jams, or photographic blurs. The relationship between humans and technology is seemingly defined by technological versus analogue or 'man made', but what happens when these two things cross over? The result is rather messy, and that's where our work comes in - to try and make sense of that 'messiness'.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agency used stamps, photocopiers and hand drawn typefaces to experiment with different visual effects, even purchasing a vintage Olivetti Lettera 32 Typewriter. The logo that we settled on was a hand drawn custom mark that alludes to the monospaced fonts used for coding, with varying degrees of 'analogue noise' built up around the letters. In each instance there is a careful balance between noise and legibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we paired the logo with a tagline, 'Making sense of the digital', some brand colours, including a bright and bold yellow, and two typefaces, Generika Mono and Barlow, which you can see in use on the website. We also printed lots of stickers, folders, envelopes, business cards, and a logo stamp, which we had fun stamping over all the blank paper in the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe New Website\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next step was to build a new website from scratch. For each of our main projects we have independent websites that serve the function of the project, for example the interactive site for Data Detox Kit, or the article format for Our Data Our Selves. That meant that the core organisation website needed to pull all of these independent projects together under one roof, giving them a comprehensive overview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few new features with the site that you might have already noticed: an independently scrolling sidebar that stays put as you navigate your way round to give you the latest news and organisation info; a related content feature based on background themes that find commonalities between projects; the yellow tags that are there to tell you what content is (and an excuse to show off the new brand colour); and a whole lot of work in the background to transform the way that we build websites and create content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though the public launch of the website was a huge milestone, there's still lots of work to do. Not least, publishing our 2018 Annual Report, making some more tweaks to the website and creating a digital archive from the past 15 years of work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGet in Touch\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you've got any questions or feedback about the new website then we would love to hear from you.

I have seen the promises of technology liberating this and that, I have seen the fears of technology taking away this and that. We have seen a lot in the last 30-plus years, since we all got hooked on the internet, since the speed of data processing and storage became the norm, and our muscles started to twitch to phantom vibrations, and swiping became the gesture of the last decade.

All the other stacks, layers that we've built on top of that since the first electromechanical programmable and binary computer, the Z1, built around 1937 by\nKonrad Zuse (it doesn't really matter who started it, but somehow it's interesting who will finish it), give us a strange sense of great variety - when there isn't much of it. This also has to do with how reduced it is from a political point of view - everything we compute has to be calculable - has to be translated into what computers can process.

The above is a graphic explanation from the Everything Will Be Fine exhibition of how data companies profile people from their personal data in order to anticipate how they might react to different issues and therefore different crises. Most of us have no idea that this kind of business is creeping beneath our clicks, and that our supposed opinions are being persistently manipulated online. One of the things these companies are exploiting is growing polarisation. I look at certain behaviours online, especially those that get instant stratospheric amplification, that play and win the attention game - I look at them and I can't stop thinking - look what the computer made them do.

Paradoxically, what was once conceived as a tool to produce reliable results based on unreliable technology (which was the idea of the first computer envisioned by von Neumann and Morgenstern in their 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour) has been comically reversed. It feels like we have come full circle, while the components of our computers are becoming incredibly reliable they seem to producing less and less reliable results.

What I can see through my little pinhole is, frankly, naked anger, and anger is a powerful force. Sometimes a force that makes us move beyond our comfort zones, stand up to injustice, engage with ideas we find overwhelming and difficult. Yet, anger is also a brutal force, a blinding force that makes us do ugly things. There is a fine line between these two kinds of anger. One we should try to manage, the other we should recognise and use (and we struggle to see which is which, and digital tools are bad at helping).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eI see a lot of anger directed at those in power, or conversely at those who would challenge those in power (depending on who is shouting through a digital megaphone and using and manufacturing trolls), or at people who are not like us, who might threaten our traditions.

Now it seems that the planning of the trip is the other way round, apparently we have to have some technology because we have to, because that is what the market says, or some random billionaires broadcast to millions of their followers, or it has been suggested by very well trained algorithms.

Although I have seen it before - when one political normativity collapses and is replaced by another (I am old enough to have seen the collapse of the Cold War), it was not replaced by something coherent and better. Nor was it done by a single person, or a single act. It was the result of the accumulation of thousands of actions, expressions, sacrifices and perseverances.

I also feel like it is not about another but better social media – we need definitely something more interesting then free and open source, federated and encrypted version of Meta. Maybe instead of inventing technological solutions we should in parallel simply reinvest and reimagine our social structures. I know from my political past – never underestimate how important self education is, how important inspiration is, how important it is to work with anyone and everyone who works with knowledge – that being libraries, community centres, informal groups, collectives, art spaces and determined individuals.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cSingleImage format=\"small\" src=\"/website2023/Insights/Insights7.png\" alt=\"Selfportrait interrupted\" caption=\"Selfportrait interrupted, 2023\"\u003e\u003c/SingleImage\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSo, in conclusion, we have looked, in a rather disorganised way, at how technology defines, determines and shapes the way we perceive our role in the world under crisis and its limitations. We looked at some examples of how it can be used as a tool of hope - making us work to prepare for the unexpected, to fix the fixable, to make escape plans, and how we would agree which roads to take to get to a better future than the one we see being predicted. We looked at examples of how technology makes us feel that we are in control as long as we act collectively, and how technology actually makes things very complicated, how we get sucked into confusion and information disorder.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAt Tactical Tech, with our expertise in technology and society as well as our practical experience in connecting this to peoples politics, in our next phase of work we will be addressing the confluence of two major problems.

We need to do more together, across borders, experiences and expertise, the discussions we need to have about technology need to be inclusive and diverse, and they need to be relatable yet forward looking.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eOur room for manoeuvre, caught between the scale and gravity of the problems we need to solve and the inadequacy of the tools we have at our disposal, requires us to rethink the methods and strategies we can produce in the limited time we have at our disposal. Particularly in the sphere of influence, we are suffering from a massive polarisation of opinions, confusion and a growing state of information disorder. We are seeing that the battle is not about how we gather evidence or analyse the data (although that is still a big problem as long as it remains proprietary), but rather how we build compelling narratives about what needs to be done and how we can influence the discussion and get on board those who make decisions. At Tactical Tech we work with experts, professionals and practitioners like journalists, NGOs and technologists who can frame the narrative and explore what solutions we should be promoting and investing in. Our role is to work practically to advance techniques and counter the impact of the opinion and influence apparatus that is so negatively present in how we engage with, understand and act on climate and environmental degradation.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn parallel, we need more public engagement with the problem of understanding the double acceleration of the digital and the environmental, and the connection between the two. Until communities have the space to find their own ways through the questions that these changes bring and in their own contexts, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for them to make the right choices. This is why Tactical Tech relies heavily on working with anchor organisations, institutions that are embedded in their communities, either in their role as knowledge brokers (libraries, schools, cultural and community centres) or as representatives\nof local and grassroots knowledge, who are trusted and know the context of their\ncommunities' needs and aspirations better than anyone else.

The result of the second phase can be seen in the annotated bibliography included in this report. The collection process paid special attention to experiences that put learners at the center of the experience, rather than a piece of equipment or software. Attention was also given to case studies and research articles that tackled problems related to lack of resources and access, and that also took into consideration a variety of environments (beyond schools) to help young people learn independently.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch3\u003eNotes on learning: conversations with researchers and practitioners\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn the world of DML, there are many avenues for learning. It is fair to say that, just as DML itself, learning is also complex and difficult to assess. However, a brief exploration of the ideas shared to date by researchers and practitioners can be a great deal of help in designing resources and learning experiences. In particular, these ideas can help educators look beyond technology and steer clear of outdated or less effective teaching and learning models. Keeping students at the center while designing learning interventions and programs, rather than tools or teachers, is an effective methodology that is likely to result in personalized experiences for the learners.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eObservations around formal and informal learning can be helpful in order to understand young students’ independence when using digital technologies (2). Marcia Conner’s models (3) can help explain the difference between formal and informal learning, as well as the various learning opportunities that could arise in different groups and spaces. In the first diagram, Conner illustrates how learning can be formal or informal, intentional or unexpected, and how these types of learning can interact with one another.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cSingleImage format=\"small\" src=\"MLCE/researcher_report/mlc-infgb09.jpeg\" caption=\"Diagram from “Introduction to Informal Learning” by Marcia L.

In both spaces, learning can happen intentionally or in unexpected ways. Some experts talk about ‘invisible curricula’ and how students can experience learning that is not part of the main educational plan(4) or even about ‘serendipity learning’(5) in which certain learning experiences come as a ‘happy accident’ of sorts.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAnother of Conner’s models points to non-formal spaces, which could be seen as halfway between the formal and the informal experience. \u003cb\u003eNon-formal experiences\u003c/b\u003e can be structured and have a clear objective but they don’t tend to belong to institutional curricula. Oftentimes, these experiences take place within different kinds of communities and in collaboration with various groups.

Some authors call it \"unintentional\" and others link it to \"invisible learning\" or even \"incidental learning\", because it happens in conjunction with the circumstances surrounding the experience. It is not in the program, or the title, but people still 'leave with it'. For example, at school, students learn how to socialize, how to read hidden tones, and how to treat their peers. Another nice example comes when watching series and movies, language and cultural learning can happen there, even though the person watching is not actually setting out to learn any of those things. Non-intentional learning happens when the individual is not coming with the intention of acquiring any new skill or with a conscious intention to learn.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eMany researchers in education sciences agree that both informal and non-intentional experiences are key, with many of them arguing that most of the knowledge we actually acquire comes from experiences in informal atmospheres(6).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eWe can take these ideas into account and cross them with observations from DML experiences and assessments made by institutions like Nominet and their 2022 Digital Youth Index(7), which highlights how young people have strong self study skills—that is, the capacity to teach oneself—and a tendency to learn through a combination of formal experiences (in school, with their teachers) with informal ones (at home, with peers).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eOther studies and experiences shared and commented on by researchers and practitioners José Luis Mendoza(8) and Adrián Carrera Ahumada(9) revealed the importance of considering the non-formal and the informal, highlighting that the most successful learning experiences in their work happened when “[learners] didn’t notice”(10)—that is, in an informal, non-intentional, or unexpected way.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSome of these practitioners made learning spaces out of their social media pages and started sharing key tools and insights about DML with their followers. After a while, according to the practitioners, followers started creating and sharing useful and interesting content themselves, suggesting that the passage from information consumers to creators could be a way to assess learning(11). At the same time, researchers like Linn Friedrichs, for example, stress the importance of observing how young people can use social media to engage with and promote causes that are important to them, as well as build meaningful connections online with communities that share their values(12).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn parallel, it would be useful to analyze these experiences and ideas in combination with approaches coming from critical literacy while taking into account the ways some learners around the world are bound to develop some of these skills in tense digital environments marked by censorship or authoritarianism, where actors need to constantly respond to various limitations(13).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eCrossing these ideas together points at the importance of taking into account informal and non-intentional learning experiences. This could help in the design of programs and spaces that can work as “patchworks” of experiences that can be combined in different ways. For example, a program could combine lessons in the classroom with individual study time at the library, as well as diverse assignments students can do in groups or alone. Another example could be a collaboration between a school and an organization that integrates non-formal programs (a data privacy or digital security training) into a wider DML program taking place as part of the formal school curriculum. The idea is to combine and integrate activities inside and outside the school, online and off, as a way to ‘capitalize’ on students’ learning capacity in autonomy while being guided by educators.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cHeadingWithText background=\"white\" heading='Notes on the research question: from “what works?” to “what did they learn?”'\u003e\u003c/HeadingWithText\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAs highlighted before, evaluating results and identifying effective methods in the realm of digital literacy, as with many other educational experiences, can be quite challenging.

These labels do not seem to be helpful in understanding how young people and adults learn, nor how they can learn from each other(20). Teachers and students both bring unique experiences to the table, and it is essential to recognize the value of each perspective. While young people tend to be more comfortable with digital environments and devices, they may lack critical thinking skills when it comes to the content they encounter online. In contrast, some teachers may struggle with digital tools but have a mature and critical perspective on the information they find online. At the same time, with the passing of time, there will be fewer people in the workplace that have known a time before heavily digitalized environments and the main intergenerational difference may arise in terms of the kind of digital tools they’re familiar with, not with whether or not they are digitally literate.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIt is, however, of crucial importance to take teachers’ and practitioners’ experiences in DML to be able to work on robust learning programs for younger participants that can be well adapted and sustainable in time. Such an exploration needs to also take into account learning resources for teachers and educators, as well as training spaces and strategies for these groups. It is not about having teachers that “know it all” in terms of technology, but rather it is key that they are open to learn and evolve in a universe of change. Teachers’ and practitioners’ own DMLskills need constant developing and updating, and it is they who will ensure that whatever program is developed could be adapted and updated as new tools arise and new students join the group.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThere is a need to expand DML training programs for teachers and explore ways for teachers to learn continuously and informally, both among themselves and with their students. Some of the most important challenges are related not to technology itself, but to the recognition of students’ and teachers’ learning abilities, lack of access, and the need to surpass certain misconceptions about learning and evaluation (like the fact that the only valuable learning experiences happen inside of the school or that learning can only be measured through quantitative methods). Most of the skills educators are aiming for—reading media critically, being able to write and read comprehensively, and develop a certain independence when interacting with different digital environments—remain similar to those of the past and continue to be necessary to be able to take advantage of the new powerful tools we see rising today.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDML benefits from “patchwork blankets” and alliances\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eWhen developing DML programs, it is important to remember that digital literacy is not a singular concept but instead encompasses various other important literacies and skills. These skills also call for the inclusion of areas of critical knowledge such as gender and intercultural communication. Gender, in particular, plays a significant role in digital literacy (and digital safety) conversations, as an important number of online violence cases are linked to online harassment and hostile environments against girls, women, and people who are LGBTQIA+.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAt the same time, digital rights organizations globally can provide updated and important information for educational purposes. As a certain gap seems to exist between the world of digital rights and the world of formal education, DML projects can help build a necessary bridge between these two worlds.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eFurthermore, cultural elements and power imbalances in online representations must be considered when building resources. Using and adapting community-produced(21) media from other parts of the world can help promote cultural exchange and avoid bias. To this end, curricula should be accompanied by the use of resources developed by different organizations aiming to encourage better internet policies based on a combination of values(22).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eWith this multiplicity of issues and elements, working on a DML program that is coherent with the people that use it could translate into a tool that can be structured and restructured by its users. For example, a program might be designed to focus on certain areas (like comprehensive reading, media production) and include information on other DML areas (like online safety and misinformation, for example). That way, the focus of the program can be more adaptable to current contexts. We could think of a model that works as a “patchwork blanket” combining autonomous strategies (like work at the library, research on a particular subject, or content creation) with activities in class, as well as various school subjects, allowing it to become a collaboration with different teachers.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThese initiatives can also be supported by the creation of spaces online and offline with a focus on certain areas (as tends to be the case with digital security communities); or even the reconditioning of libraries or community centers that can enhance independent learning while still counting on support and guidance from educators.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAnnotated bibliography\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003cb\u003eGuidelines and resources\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\n\u003cText\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUNESCO.\u003ca href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377068\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eMedia and information literate citizens: think critically, click wisely!\u003c/i\u003eUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2021.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eA robust compilation of theoretical approaches that includes curriculum samples as resources to be used by educators and practitioners.

In short, we make a commitment to the trustworthy foundation of our version of events, our interpretation of the facts and the validity of our conclusions. In this context, the material we choose to work with (data, that is) appears to be something solid, comprehensive, authentic, perhaps even neutral and unquestionable. In some areas of data visualisation and evidence–based storytelling, we may come close to this pure notion of data. But, more often, we have to deal with the opposite scenario, in which the data we have access to is unreliable, fragmentary, imprecise, random, unpleasant, hypothetical, risky, dubious... the list goes on.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThis text will provide some examples of how to deal with such data sets and how to work through them in order to yield interesting results and stories. One method is to encourage people to look for datasets, to ask for them, to collect them and then to use them. The other approach is to be admit that the data we end up working with is questionable, if not basically sh..y.

To put this hypothesis in the context of Tactical Tech’s work, in questioning the way Big Tech operates and trying to expose its social and political risks, they, Big Tech and its acolytes, maintain a high level of signal ambiguity (not silence, but ambiguity) on their part. It is as if you are dealing with an elusive substance (the dark matter, the silence of outer space – in our case we call it simply “grey data”) that makes it difficult to make definitive conclusions, and which hides any significant notions of negative impact. At the same time, these same companies and businesses have a sophisticated apparatus that knows a lot about the users of their services and infrastructure (on which we, the users, often depend). If you manage to lift the carpet a little too successfully, you are either flagged as a rule–breaker, or, again following the dark forest principle, you are silenced (fired from your job like some AI experts, your social media monitored or otherwise ridiculed, etc.).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSo maybe instead of stretching the Dark Forest Hypothesis too much – we should give it a new name: while not wanting to use gaslighting (emotional abuse), we should perhaps call it the Great Silicon Valley Swindle, a kind of sophisticated multi–actor deception in which one group is told to give up their data for free and dependable services while the other groups is asked to give money for influence.

The red set contains all of the publicly available admissions, apologies, lessons learned, pledges and promises made by Mark Zuckerberg from 2003, when he launched his first product called Facemash, until the end of 2019 (when we made the object, just after the Cambridge Analytica scandal).

One way of approaching this would be to weigh all the public statements Zuckerberg has made against all the questions he has been asked by policy makers, which might lead to some interesting conclusions, such as some of the questions were naive, or that they were asking about things he had already promised to fix or apologised for a long time ago. Or we could try to make some sense of his public voice (statements) versus his inner voice (the internal crib sheet). Would we learn more than that these two voices seem contradictory?\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eOur assumption was the opposite: we assumed these data sets were incomparable – a classic case of apples and oranges. Comparing them will not reveal anything meaningful. On the other hand, seeing how incomparable these sets are is already a story we wanted to tell, and we wanted to let the audience explore it at their own pace and interest. We were aware that for some, particularly in San Francisco where we were showing the object, it might be an insight into how you should or could run a company that wants to “move fast and break things,” and for others, it might be an illustration of the immense gap between those who break the rules and those who define them, and the fact that a company like Facebook defines far more rules than it breaks. The modus operandi of Big Tech companies is to enter unregulated territories at the intersection of new technologies, society and politics, push as far as they can into the first cracks they see, and then activate their legal and lobbying apparatuses to mitigate potential damage, while continuing to push into other areas that are not yet on anyone's radar, especially those whose radars are clearly out of date.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThe two pages immortalised by the AP photographer are a tiny, specific and fragmentary glimpse into the strategy of a multi-billion-dollar company at risk of losing the public’s trust, being advised to come clean and with as few consequences for the business itself as possible. In the end, the scandal cost Facebook 643,000 USD in the UK and a 5 billion civil penalty in the US. Including legal costs and other costs the whole defence doesn’t compare with their 2019 revenue, clocked at seventy billion US dollars. The fine paid equalled roughly 7.1% of its annual revenue. And how should we interpret Zuckerberg's devotion to jiu–jitsu, which recently made him win some tournament medals? If you are wondering what this has to do with anything, jiu–jitsu (in particular the Brazilian jiu–jitsu he prefers) is one of the few martial arts that specialises in diverting and deflecting the force of an opponent, a masterclass in dodging.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch2\u003e“You might regret what you wish for” data\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn 2016, together with artist Joana Moll, Tactical Tech decided to test the following hypothesis: it is possible to buy a lot of personal data legally and openly. At the time, there were many discussions about what kind of data was and wasn’t available, and affordable, along with a lot of questions about how the data broker business works. But there weren't so many documented examples. So the idea was to focus specifically on data from dating websites (as it is, by default, very personal) and to use only legal and open forms of data brokering (no dark net data buying). We identified the US broker website (in case you want to replicate our process – it is not possible for the datasets we got access to – thanks to Joana's and our research) and went online to buy some records. We decided to buy 1 million profiles for 136 euros from a service called Usdata, paying with our credit card.

The point of our investigation was to make users of web services based on detailed profiles aware of the consequences of sharing data with relatively unknown companies with unclear privacy policies and undisclosed business models. Our aim was not to expose any of the personal data we might get our hands on, and certainly not to expose any users who have already fallen victim to terrible data practices.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eSo how do you show the results of your research?

By extracting the metadata from the images, they were able to reverse-engineer a hidden network of companies owned by other companies that apparently shared their data without users' consent across many of their own dating services (please read the actual research mentioned above). By analysing all the websites, they unraveled a vast network of third parties that enabled cookies and trackers (which do allow advertising) were given access to collect live data from users of the above dating services. They counted over 300 third–party cookies on sites owned by Match Group and IAC (which owns most of the dating sites that you know very well and those you may have never heard of).\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eJoana's key principle in the research, and in the artistic project that came out of this collaboration, was not to expose the people behind the data that we had access to. And yet we felt it was important to show the nature and scale of the data that was being processed and that was available to anyone, even with limited resources. The research part was easier to manage from this perspective – as the data we had was used as a source for expanding the research and collecting company data – there was no risk of exposing the data we had.

It is updated every three minutes or so. There is no way for the visitor to make their own request or ask for specific data sets, but you can of course move between these randomised data sets extracted from the 1 million profiles. Each auction has a price tag: it is not a price you have to pay, but rather a provocation to get the visitor to evaluate what a price could or should be for such detailed and personal data sets. If you decide to 'buy' (there is no transaction involved – the project does not collect any data from its visitors), you will see pictures (in blue) of all the people whose data is being auctioned. By clicking on a picture, you can look at a specific individual record. Joana decided to go to the limit in terms of possible exposure of people, minimising this risk as much as possible. For the provocation to be a provocation, she had to retain an element of risk – either of finding oneself in the dataset, or of finding people one might know. However, the following steps make this almost impossible. There is no way to access the entire raw data set. The data is presented in randomised chunks – where there is no way for the visitor to interrogate it. You cannot search for any names, places or other variables – there is no way to query, filter or explore the data. All you are given is a random small subset of data every three minutes – there is no way to go back to previous auctions, either. The images used are blurred. There is also an emergency button to remove a face, as despite all the efforts to blur faces (automated) there is a small chance that some of the faces might still be borderline recognisable. The emergency button allows people interacting in the data to immediately trigger the removal of the face from the dataset.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Scavengers6.png\" alt=\"Joanna Moll, taken in May 2023\"\u003e The snapshot of the images view from the random Auction, Joana Moll, taken in May 2023\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThis uncanny part of the project (the potential of finding yourself or someone you know), which triggers our worst buyer's instincts, is essential to the project.

McGrath in 2015 for our Exposing The Invisible project, to introduce and explain the tool he had previously created, called ICWATCH. The tool he created consisted at the time of a database of an estimated 27,000 LinkedIn CVs of people working in the intelligence sector. The method of obtaining the data was very simple – M.C. ran a script that looked for any CV posted on LinkedIn that might have mentioned any of the code words relating to specific intelligence, surveillance and similar secret projects. It turned out that people working in this sector, looking for new opportunities, inevitably needed to use some recognisable references and professional slang that would prove their experience and expertise. M.C., driven by different principles, decided not to protect the identities of all these 27,000 or so people, but to expose them. His decision was based on the assumption that this data is available to everyone, that anyone can run similar scripts, and that it is in itself a security threat to a sector that should be more aware of it and able to do something about it.

Because what we termed the influence industry is inherently opaque. Our primary evidence is based on analysis of self–described services, methodologies and tools – which we have no easy way of verifying, some of which may just be bravado, some of which may be gross overestimation, some of which may be PR, some of which may be the old school 'fake it until you make it' mantra. On the other hand, it is clear that the unprecedented production and accumulation of personal data (including the behaviours, habits, beliefs, and aspirations of people who use the web for basically everything these days) is opening up unprecedented ways of exploring and exploiting it.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThe question we often ask is not really whether these data-driven methods work or how effective they are, but rather what sort of potential they have. What if the tools, the automation, the algorithms get significantly better and the people using them get more sophisticated? In a way, we are not looking at what we have now – but rather what future we are building now by allowing current practices to grow widely without much oversight or concern.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eOver time, we have been able to expand our dataset from the UK and US using access to public registers of political party spending; it requires a lot of work to match the generic descriptions of spending with actual services that might be linked to actual political influence tools and practices. What we also suspect, looking at the figures, is that these practices are mainly available to the parties and candidates who are able to pay for them, widening the gap between small and large parties and expanding the political influence of those who can afford it.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThere's another thing we don't have data on yet: the techniques we've analysed not only can help political entities gain power, but they also certainly generate revenue, as they ask for votes as well as for material support (donations), often in exchange for swag. This aspect of using the Influencer Industry's toolset to increase one's financial capacity still needs to be explored and analysed.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEphemeral Data or How to Build Time Capsules\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eIn 2019, we wanted to do some work on technology in exceptional times, in times of crisis. We were interested in finding out what kind of technology gets recognition during times when there is a massive need for solutions and a lot of resources are being put into solving those problems. And since we live in a time where almost any solution involves technology, we wanted to make some observations about AI in crisis in particular. When we were working on the concept and applying for funding (which we got from Onassis Stegi and won us an Ars Electronica nomination, we had different types of crisis in mind: environmental, political, social, economic, and so on. By the way, when we were about to start the project, Covid took over everything. So we thought we would not miss this opportunity.

We made it clear that we were not looking for technologies related to vaccine development, and as much as Covid trackers and their role in the public discourse were a focus, we did not want to confine our research to them. The basic questions we were asking were, during a crisis, what kind of technologies get more traction and what kind of developments become normalised and taken for granted post–crisis? Are there new technologies being developed? What kind of technological development is accelerated? And finally, can we see any patterns and trends in terms of what kind of practices get traction?\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eThe idea was not to try to build a comprehensive dataset that could be used as a solid reference on the players and their tools. But knowing that we were dealing with a temporary but intense crisis, there would be a lot of garbage we have to deal with, a lot of opportunistic ideas, a lot of repurposing of existing solutions, looking for new problems to attract some funding, etc. The idea from the start was to take a snapshot – an arbitrary, experimental, fluid and even controversial look at something that we felt no one else was looking at from such an angle.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eWhat did we find?

Ambient Intelligence: solutions are mostly based on large-scale (populations) and largely depersonalised data (this is not to say that it is not possible to de–anonymise these datasets, but the technologies do not require this, per se).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2. Biometric Intelligence: unlike technologies that rely on ambient intelligence, the source is always a specific individual. Data is aggregated and so on, but the link to the subject is the closest, such as in technologies like personal trackers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3. Mobility Intelligence: from today's point of view, this will not really stand out as a significant category, but at the time the data was collected, this was one of the dominant problems – how to manage mobility in a dangerous environment, that is, when mobility amplifies the spread of the virus.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e4. Behavioural Intelligence: this may look like a version of biometric intelligence, but it's not. Here, we're talking about individual and group behaviour and how to control it (such as behaviour in crowded places) as well as how to modify it by training people to develop new behaviour, specifically in places like offices, schools, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eAs noted above, the purpose of this data snapshot was not to provide a comprehensive overview of all the technologies that are being developed and promoted, but rather to try to capture what they are potentially normalising, as opposed to what would have been difficult to talk about prior to the crisis. One clear example here is location data: many companies would not readily admit that they had access to and processed such data. On the other hand, we also observed a significant push to normalise the use of space and behavioural control tools that would have been considered invasive prior to the pandemic, such as closed circuit camera networks with sensors, or sensor networks that monitor people in spaces. Another important observation we were able to make is that the majority of critical technological capabilities in times of crisis are in the hands of the private sector, not the public sector.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eBut to make it even more interesting and intriguing, we decided to screenshot every single website promoting the tools in focus and link them to their promotional videos. In many cases we had to use the Internet Archive – as solutions were coming and going very quickly, which we saw as a feature of the project rather than a problem. We found it fascinating the kinds of individual metaphors and narratives used by these companies to promote their solutions, and we wanted to present them for visitors to explore and draw their own conclusions.\u003c/Text\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cText\u003eLooking at it post–pandemic, we can see a ring of debris left behind by all these technological solutions, like the ring of defunct satellites littering Earth's orbit.

In which case, the usefulness of such a map would be rather questionable. Still, the idea of creating a map like this belongs in the category of pure speculation, based on the premise that one would have total access to all possible information to create it and to process such an improbable amount of data.  It is so easy to debunk this notion it took Jorge Luis Borges a paragraph to describe it in his 1946 \"On Exactitude in Science.\" (2) Yet the idea of Total Information Awareness still prevails (3), from the national security services to Silicon Valley and Shenzhen. The idea can be summed up in one sentence: If only we could collect all the information out there, we could prevent what needs to be prevented and predict what needs to be predicted – while making piles of profit and living a peaceful and beautiful life in the name of preventing terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you map an empire from a disadvantaged position, you have a situation that is a bit like using binoculars the other way around. The empire is looking at us (the subjects) through a ridiculously large telescope, seeing all the little details, while we are looking at it from the other side, obviously seeing it at an impossible distance, with minimal detail, even further away than it actually is...(4) But perhaps this disadvantage can be turned into a useful method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what are you left with when you try to map the empire of the five Big Tech companies, one of them, or other companies that benefit from the sophisticated digital infrastructure that the big five have amassed and control? You are left trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I describe some of it, let's first clarify why we call the Google (Alphabet) empire, or GAFAM (an acronym for Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our understanding of empire here is very basic: empire controls three basic layers of knowledge: 1) collection of data/intelligence, 2) storage of that intelligence, as well as 3) capacity of processing it. These three unique characteristics give them powerful and unprecedented insights into how our societies operate.” (05) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's somewhat arbitrary to use the term “empire” at this point, but let's stick with it for a while, just for the sake of argument. The same goes for the use of the term “knowledge” or ”intelligence,” but isn't that what collected data becomes when used to train various machine-learning and AI models?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAfter all, we are in the business of provocation design (06). This is what we do here - we turn limited data, corrupted information and grey areas into engaging and stimulating visual prompts for critical thinking.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of mapping the unprecedented influence of big tech companies, using all the methods available, including licencia poetica (07), is to try to demystify, on the one hand, who these companies are and, on the other hand, the powerful tools they have at their disposal. These are tools they use to influence how we perceive what is important, how we understand, for example, what a crisis is through the lens of technology, or simply how we are going to vote in the next election.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have an interesting history of many fragile, semi-confusing, but amusing and successful attempts at such mapping. We are a tiny fish in this vast ocean. But we have our tools and our ideas. We are persistently putting together different narratives to engage different audiences in different ways with a subject that is often seen as slightly over the top (\"it's the market, stupid\"), mostly boring (\"another network map, ugh\"), and at best too technical (\"data?\") and at worst too politically biased (\"you just hate corporations, don't you?\").\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, mapping what we can see against what we cannot see can be beautiful at first, but in the long run, it can also risk representing truly problematic views. Let me take an old example, Edward Quin’s Maps of Empire (08).  Here are three examples from his original atlas:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_2.png\" alt=\"Edward Quin, Maps of Empire, 1830\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eEdward Quin, Maps of Empire, 1830 (here Alexander, Constantine and Discovery of America) images after David Rumsey Historical Map Collection - \u003ca href=\"https://www.davidrumsey.com\"\u003ehttps://www.davidrumsey.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Quin’s case, mapping is presented as a rather romantic candlelight that, over time, dispels the cloud of ignorance, showing the progress of knowledge directly related to the power of cartographers representing a very specific imperial viewpoint. First, it is assumed that expansion equals knowledge - as if the territories unknown to the cartographers and their inhabitants did not exist before. The act of cartography is subjective and political (09). The other thing we learn from this example is that visualising is associated with immediate discovery for the viewer. It is a very empowering act. In Quin's case, it ended with reprinting his atlas, omitting all his writing in favour of just the images in many future atlas editions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe like to see things in linear progress, from darkness to light, from not knowing to enlightenment, etc. But there is something else to learn from this example, and that is how much we can learn from so-called negative space - not from what is visible, but from what is bluntly invisible. One of these things is the bias and limited perspective of the mapmaker himself. It is crucial to be aware of this limitation. And perhaps the final and somewhat exaggerated lesson from this example is that no empire should map itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Growing Pains of Mapping an Empire\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's go back to our journey through our various attempts to explore how to visualise and represent the unprecedented position that the big tech companies have gained in recent decades in terms of their impact on our society. We explored how to tell the story using different data sets, which data sets to choose and how to present them in an interesting way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started with the obvious - the “follow the money” mantra. Why follow the money (10)? Because when money is present, there are transactions; when there are transactions, there are values (not only monetary), and there is power. So when we talk about Big Tech, we, in fact, talk about a sector that processes lots of money, more than we can actually imagine: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGAFAM’s market capitalisation counts in the trillions (11)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGAFAM is made out of the most profitable businesses in existence (12)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGAFAM holds a massive number of patents (13)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGAFAM includes the most valued brands worldwide (14)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGAFAM’s owners and CEOs are some of the wealthiest people in the world.

(16)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince we know how much money these companies make, and we somehow know how they spend it, we could make some observations here. It turns out that neither is that obvious, and both sets of data (profit, money spent on investment and acquisitions) are riddled with corporate PR, copy/paste journalism and a lack of corporate transparency. But we gave it a go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_3.png\" alt=\"Google Empire 2016, Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle Empire 2016, Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma – photo Andrea Figari (left) \u0026#x26; Daniel Desiderio Paez Castillo (right), as exhibited at the exhibition “Nervous Systems“ at HKW Berlin. (17)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe above is our first modest 3D visualisation from 2016, based on a dataset of about 180 companies that Google acquired and 400 companies that they have invested in since 1998. What we learnt very quickly compiling this dataset was that it needed to be more reliable.  It was very hard to verify the numbers we had collected; some information contradicted our initial research, and because it was much easier to look at acquisitions than investments, it was impossible to verify accuracy. We decided to simplify (the above-mentioned licencia poetica) the visual representation. It is basically a good-looking timeline where both acquisitions and investments are represented as two types of bars. While the size of the bar roughly represents the amount of money, the colour shows what kind of category a given transaction belongs to in terms of its primary field of business (such as education, robotics, etc.). We made an arbitrary decision that in cases where we had conflicting numbers (actual money spent or invested), we would average them while making it clear in the description.  It was essential to show that Google is more than what we think and definitely more than the sum of its parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon after that exhibition, we were about to show our work in New York and wanted to make a better impression there. We came up with another version based on the same dataset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_4.png\" alt=\"Google Empire, 2016 Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle Empire, 2016 Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma, New York, Glass Room exhibition produced by Mozilla, photo Tactical Tech\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time we decided to go for a network map made of nails and coloured threads, where each investment or acquisition is represented by the dot (nail), and the size of the circle represents the money spent/invested. The colour of the thread indicates the category of business, similar to the previous version. We thought this was a better representation of the size and scope of these nearly 600 deals, and we could not resist embedding Eric Schmidt's infamous quote, \"We know where you are\" (18) into the data representation itself. The main reason for moving away from the previous version was that it did not do justice to the scale and scope of these operations, and it continued to alienate - rather than embrace - viewers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_5.png\" alt=\"Google Empire, 2016 Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eFragment, Google Empire at the Glass Room London 2017, photo David Mirzoeff.

Being part of the enrichment of public knowledge through our work with libraries, schools, hackerspaces, maker spaces, and community centres is also very rewarding. In the last two years, we have co-organised almost 500 events in 61 countries, with over 350,000 participants.

We didn't think the scale or the amounts would make an impression in the heart of Silicon Valley. So we set out to create what we called “Google and You”. (23) We updated the datasets from 2016/17 and 2018 to the most recent dataset from the end of 2019. This time we excluded investments and decided to go exclusively with all known acquisitions. We ended up presenting these as a set of 250 products and services owned by Google.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_12.jpg\" alt=\"Google and You, Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle and You, Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; LaLoma, 2019, photo author\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea was very simple. We decided first to show the ten most used services offered by Google (we still like to call Alphabet “Google”). We presented them as rotating plates stacked on top of each other; each plate had a dotted pattern representing the known number of current users of that service. You would think this would be easy to find out - it is not. Google sometimes gives some figures, and journalists report slightly different ones. Again, there is no transparency about how many users a particular service has, either in total or how many log on or use it each month. We chose only those that exceeded the magic number of 1 billion or more, starting with Android, which at the time had almost 3 billion users worldwide. Unlike the previous objects and visualisations, we did not want to show Google as a powerful company just because it can afford to invest and spend a lot of money to acquire other companies (which also means acquisition, talent, skills, infrastructure, code, ideas and maybe sometimes competition). Rather, we wanted to show how much we depend on its services and solutions, its hardware and software. And to show that there is much more to Google than the ten most used applications. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_13.png\" alt=\"Google and You, mock-up of the object\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGoogle and You, mock-up of the object, LaLoma, 2019\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe object was quite complicated because the elements rotated. We wanted it to look abstractly like a series of stacked Google lenses, each with a different focus (aka the number of users), hovering over the global number of internet users (24), represented as transparent mini people at the bottom of the stack, each representing 10 000,000 internauts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may have been the last time we produce such a fragile object. People loved rotating the lenses and the outer ring with 250 services. Somehow, at the end of the day, tens of the plastic people would be broken off the base plate. For the 21 days of the exhibition, I would come there early with my coffee and a tube of Super Glue and spend 30 minutes glueing them back on day after day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_14.png\" alt=\"Google and You close-up, ibidem, picture author\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle and You close-up, ibidem, picture author\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one thing that worked with this semi-interactive 3D visualisation: It brought together three parts - the staggering number of Google users, the incredible advertising revenue and the company's buying power - all growing together with the unique dependency between the majority of the world's internet users and the company. At the same time, The San Francisco Glass Room exhibition won us the Creative Review Annual Award. (25)\\\nWe were ready for the next challenge: most of our public activities were cancelled at the beginning of 2020, except for our collaboration with FERS (26) and a series of exhibitions in Dutch libraries. (27) For this occasion, we rolled up our sleeves and concentrated on producing a piece called Google Society, a better version of Google and You.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_15.jpg\" alt=\"Google Society  - Tactical Tech \u0026#x26;  LaLoma, 2020\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle Society  - Tactical Tech \u0026#x26;  LaLoma, 2020, photo author, exhibited in Leeuwarden 2021\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_16.png\" alt=\"Google Society  - Tactical Tech \u0026#x26;  LaLoma, 2020\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGoogle Society-Tactical Tech \u0026#x26;  LaLoma, 2020, photo author, exhibited in Leeuwarden 2021\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe updated the dataset again and rearranged the object, which looks like a modern version of a camera obscura (28) or a giant artificial jellyfish, ready for the digital world to conquer.

On the opposite side, we have the Google eye, where its retina is made up of all sorts of personal data collected as it peers through the web of connections between the hundreds of services it offers.

Practically three weeks before our original idea of launching GAFAM Empire on 21 April 2021, the Washington Post published their “How Big Tech Got So Big: Hundreds of Acquisitions35.” (34)  There were far too many similarities between their work and ours that we decided to postpone and rethink our approach, as well as see where we could add something the Washington Post piece did not have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_20.png\" alt=\"Initial data analysis of our GAFAM empire from early 2021\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eInitial data analysis of our GAFAM empire from early 2021, research Patrick Harvey, Data Analysis and categorisation Basile Simon (35).\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir piece focused on two aspects of big tech acquisitions - first, that they are different from what they were when they started. Second, that they get big as Company A, and then they spend the money on acquisitions and become Company B. For example, Amazon started as an online bookstore and became a cloud computing powerhouse, but to everyday users, they are mostly known as a retail company. The data team at the Washington Post did some really great visualisations. But they reduced it to a timeline. More importantly, they made it clear that their efforts, much like ours, were designed to help institutions and policymakers (the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, respectively) in their fight against these companies using their monopolistic positions to a) weaken competitors and b) strengthen their grip on particular sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe returned to the drawing board and decided to wait and update the dataset and give it more nuance and depth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/gafam_evolution.png\" alt=\"One of the visualisations of GAFAM Empire 2022\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eOne of the visualisations of GAFAM Empire 2022, Tactical Tech and Density Design - we called this part Petri dishes - where we observed changes in the landscape of acquisitions in 5-year intervals. (36)\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing we focused on, and what makes our work very different from that of the Washington Post, was the problem of categorising the 1,210 acquisitions we were looking at. We quickly learnt that this was purely arbitrary, not very precise and often more PR than anything else - companies acquired might be described as just \"software\". In contrast, on closer inspection, we could say they were \"developers of mobile recognition engines for the mobile phone and consumer electronics industries, and more.\" We dug wherever we could: press, reports, company filings, and so on.  This allowed us to make much more specific observations about what these acquisitions were really about - although still with many limitations - as it is not possible to really determine why these acquisitions were made. Was the company acquiring some expertise, code, patents, ideas, talent, user base, data - some or all of it, or simply neutralising a potential competitor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing we decided to look at, which was part of the inspiring Washington Post investigation, is what we can learn about these companies through their acquisition strategies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, our findings also overlap with the Washington Post. Still, in the case of Amazon, for example, their focus is on Amazon's transition from an e-commerce giant to a cloud computing \"landlord.\" What our observations add is that they are also the most significant player in automation and robotics. In the case of Google, the Washington Post observed that they transitioned from an advertising giant to a dominant force in mobile and artificial intelligence and digital mapping. Our observations also show Google's strategic dominance in education and health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/Gafam_article_22.png\" alt=\"GAFAM Empire – fragment of Microsoft acquisitions\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGAFAM Empire – a fragment of Microsoft acquisitions – LinkedIn, Tactical Tech \u0026#x26; Density Design 2022 (37).\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also spent significant time trying to decipher their business strategies, looking not only at the actual acquisition in focus - as in the case above of Microsoft buying LinkedIn - but also scrutinising what companies like LinkedIn had bought before becoming part of Microsoft's portfolio, as well as what companies they acquired after being owned by Microsoft. In fact, researchers at the Transnational Institute took note and looked at Meta's series of purchases made via the acquisition of Oculus and how they expanded their reach into VR technologies (38). There are many cases of such complex acquisitions by all of the Big Five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the last thing that made it a big bonus for researchers and policymakers is that we published all the data in our Methodology section for scrutiny and use (39).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is not the end of our mapping adventures - we are now working on simplified versions of the GAFAM Empire, another poster, an animation and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever we do next, we could do a lot better (or more generally, we as policymakers, researchers and institutions could do a lot better in terms of better understanding the impact of these companies at large) if a few basic things were available, such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edetailed financial reports from companies that are useful to regulators and researchers (in particular, disclosing the specific purposes of acquisitions and investments, with business plans describing the intended use of acquired assets)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edetailed non-financial reports explaining the purposes of acquisitions, including inventories listing what has been acquired\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edetailed information about monetisation metrics – it is essential to know the money-making strategies and tools used by companies (what is specifically being monetised for what value?

It also assumes, as we said at the beginning, that all we need is more data, more information. To some extent, it would certainly help to define new rules of the game (new policies, regulations, restrictions, rights and responsibilities). Once again, the map becomes larger than the empire that looms around the corner.\nThe point we are making is that mapping as a process is crucial to finding ways of understanding and measuring power relations. It also helps us to get a basic orientation - where are we in this? And more importantly, all maps are temporary - by the time they are finished, they are already out of date. So it is fascinating to look at the processes and methods behind the maps while enjoying their visual representation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile - we will keep mapping.

By the time children become young adults, they are already familiar with the idea that their actions, thoughts, beliefs and emotions are data fodder for tech companies; that their circle of friends is hundreds or even thousands of people wide, including strangers and bots; that not having access to technology for a few days or hours can cause symptoms of withdrawal and panic; and that their dream job, or the jobs of their parents, may be carried out by a computer programme by the time they graduate. This is just a snapshot of the many ways that digital technologies shape young peoples’ lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are approaching a time of critical awareness about the impact technology has on the lives of young people. In 2021, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child acknowledged for the first time that \u003ca href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRC/Pages/GCChildrensRightsRelationDigitalEnvironment.aspx\" title=\"https\\://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRC/Pages/GCChildrensRightsRelationDigitalEnvironment.aspx\"\u003echildren’s rights apply in the digital world\u003c/a\u003e, and students around the world are protesting the use of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372045/uk-a-level-results-algorithm-biased-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-university-applications\" title=\"https\\://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372045/uk-a-level-results-algorithm-biased-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-university-applications\"\u003ealgorithmic decision making\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9ag4/schools-are-abandoning-invasive-proctoring-software-after-student-backlash+\" title=\"https\\://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9ag4/schools-are-abandoning-invasive-proctoring-software-after-student-backlash+\"\u003ediscriminatory technologies\u003c/a\u003e in their schools.

And yet, many of the problems persist and some are getting worse, especially in the context of the pandemic and the technological dependency that it creates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the Future Wants was born from the emerging need for critical thinking resources designed for young people, to help them understand the new and existing issues that impact them in their digital lives. What are the biggest concerns impacting young people? How can they be addressed? And how can young people become part of the effort to find solutions for themselves and for future generations?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese questions were the starting point for us at Tactical Tech, a Berlin-based NGO. For the past two decades, we have been working on how to support people to understand, unpack and reflect on technology’s place within society. Over the years we have received regular requests—from parents, educators and others working with young people—to bring our resources into educational environments. Over time, we observed the potential of these projects to give young people critical and thought-provoking tools for understanding the digital world. In 2020, we adapted the Data Detox Kit into a \u003ca href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/families/datadetox-x-youth\" title=\"https\\://datadetoxkit.org/en/families/datadetox-x-youth\"\u003eworkbook for young people,\u003c/a\u003e which has since been translated into 15 languages and has been used by parents, educators and trainers to start conversations with young people around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2021, we were given the opportunity to adapt our exhibition about how technology is shaping society, The Glass Room, for young people, which became the What the Future Wants project. Since it’s inception, The Glass Room has attracted people of all ages. Some of the most curious visitors we have had to The Glass Room were teenagers, maybe dragged in at first by a school trip or parents, but often staying longer than other visitors and asking meaningful and engaging questions. In 2019, a 14-year-old student in the Hague had seen The Glass Room at a conference that she had visited with her father and contact to us asking if she could host it at her school to teach her peers. Since then, the intervention has been hosted at multiple schools, libraries and institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/20221121_WTFW-office-setup-orange-helpers_small.png\" alt=\"Photo of two people wearing all orange hanging up a poster.\" title=\"Two colleagues hanging up one of the What the Future Wants posters; photo courtesy of Daisy Kidd\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eC﻿aption: Two colleagues hanging up one of the What the Future Wants posters; photo courtesy of Daisy Kidd\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we found out, the way youth view technology is complex, and it is not always in line with how ‘Generation Z’ are commonly understood and represented in the media. In this two-part series, we explore how Tactical Tech’s first youth-centered team co-created the public education intervention ‘\u003ca href=\"https://theglassroom.org/en/what-the-future-wants/\" title=\"https\\://theglassroom.org/en/what-the-future-wants/\"\u003eWhat the Future Wants\u003c/a\u003e,’ which was released in Spring 2022. The series outlines the initiation, delivery, and findings of the project (so far) in the hope that other organisations, initiatives, and individuals working with young people can learn from our experience and the rich insights of all of the young people who contributed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Part 1, we outline why co-creation as a method lies at the heart of our approach to a series of workshops and explain the guiding principles behind it. \u003ca href=\"https://tacticaltech.org/news/youth-co-creation-findings/\"\u003eIn Part 2\u003c/a\u003e, we go into detail about how we implemented these principles in practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eUncertainty \u003cem\u003eor\u003c/em\u003e Being okay with not knowing the answers\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe culture of uncertainty is particularly relevant in the context of the digital worlds that young people inhabit. From the outside, it may seem that young people are the masters of digital technologies, traversing new platforms, trends, and skills with ease and confidence, at a speed that is hard to keep up with. It can be alienating to enter into the world as an outsider and to find a whole generation of people who just know how this stuff works; When did they learn? And who taught them that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, to assume that young people are ‘in the know’ misses an important point: the internet and digital technologies were never designed for children(1)\u003ca href=\"#_ftn1\"\u003e﻿\u003c/a\u003e—in the same way that centuries of human knowledge and understanding led to safe and nurturing environments for children prior to the internet. Their knowledge about this digital space is self-taught and has emerged out of a necessity to take risks, belong and explore like any teenager has the right to do. The only difference is that they are developing in a new territory that is not well mapped out and so the risks and challenges that present themselves are unprecedented, to them, and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his book, ‘New Dark Age’, James Bridle writes: ‘Over the last century, technological acceleration has transformed our planet, our societies, and ourselves, but it has failed to transform our understanding of these things.’(2)\u003ca href=\"#_ftn2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHere Bridle identifies a crucial characteristic of our digital age: it is rooted in uncertainty, human understanding and comprehension has not caught up with the advancement of technologies and the myriad ways that they impact us and our surroundings. This is in part because of the normalisation of technologies. As they fit seamlessly into our everyday lives—the algorithm that decides what song you’ll listen to next, the psychological tuning that makes you stay online for hours, the supply chain that delivers a new iPhone model every year—these systems and mechanisms expertly meet our evolving needs, making it easy to stop questioning them. Even at a time when a simple search query can generate thousands or millions of possible avenues of knowledge, these vast swathes of information can leave us feeling paralyzed(3)\u003ca href=\"#_ftn3\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not fully understand the complexity of what this might mean for the next generations as these types of transformative times are rooted in uncertainty and driven by a constant state of flux. But within the uncertainty, there is an opportunity for new modes of thinking that leans towards the uncertainty and explores it with curiosity. As is written in the introduction of the  ‘Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education\u003ca href=\"#_ftn4\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e’(4), from the Association of College and Research Libraries: ‘Students have a greater role and responsibility in creating new  knowledge, in understanding the contours and the changing dynamics of  the world of information, and in using information, data, and  scholarship ethically.’ \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eCuriosity as a form of critical thinking \u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince its inception, The Glass Room exhibition has provided a space for people to be curious about technology and to explore its impact on the world. It is not a space to provide answers, but rather to pose questions and a forum for discussion. The objects on display are sometimes playful, cheeky, challenging, but more importantly, they tell a story about technology through a unique lens, giving people an entry point into a topic that may have previously seemed impenetrable.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearning from The Glass Room’s breadth of exhibition experiences, we knew that this approach of curiosity as a means for critical thinking works well with young people. The idea for co-creation was taking that concept one step further so that instead of engaging the youth perspective at the point of visiting, the curiosity mindset was built into the initiation and conceptualisation of the project. The curiosity mindset works both ways. We entered into the project with an open mind, ready to learn from the participants, trying to shed our preconceived notions that youth were addicted to their phones and unaware of data collection and targeted advertisements, and open to the possibility that everything we knew before may be turned on its head. We also wanted to encourage a curious and open mindset from the participants, towards their individual perspective on the issues at hand, like algorithmic curation and the role of influencers, but also towards each other, to allow the different cultures, backgrounds, genders, ages to promote learning and connection rather than to deepen differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/20221121_WTFW-topics-identified_small.png\" alt=\"Visual of topics of interest clustered in a web\" title=\"Visual of topics of interest clustered in a web; courtesy of Dominika Knoblochová\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eC﻿aption: Visual of topics of interest clustered in a web; courtesy of Dominika Knoblochová\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn insightful article that sheds light on this concept is from Barabara Fister as part of the Project Information Literacy Series. In article titled ‘Principled Uncertainty: Why Learning to Ask Good Questions Matters More than Finding Answers’\u003ca href=\"#_ftn5\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(5), she poses the question: ‘What can we do as educators to encourage the ethical practice of curiosity, not just for times of uncertainty but as an everyday habit?’ Her answer, to paraphrase, is that we must encourage students to lean into uncertainty rather than to retreat into the familiar. In doing this, students learn the skill of asking open-ended, exploratory questions that have no definitive answer. The learning then is in the pursuit of uncertainty, rather than the adoption of established ideas. As Fister writes: ‘An approach to uncertainty grounded in curiosity invites students to claim their own authority as they formulate their understanding. If we support them when they venture into the unknown and give them the tools  to move forward with integrity, they will be able to explore territories their teachers haven’t already mapped.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eMethods and Principles of Co-Creation\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/collectivewisdom\" title=\"https\\://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/collectivewisdom\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e from MIT’s Co-Creation Studio, the researchers define co-creation as \"an alternative to the single-author vision and involves a  constellation of media production methods, frameworks, and feedback systems. In co-creation, projects emerge from process and evolve from within communities, with people, rather than for, or about these  communities.”(6)\u003ca href=\"#_ftn6\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MIT study identifies four types of co-creation: ‘within communities (real world and virtual), across disciplines, and humans working with non-human systems.’ The What the Future Wants project followed type one: co-creation in communities, in person(7)\u003ca href=\"#_ftn7\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. What became clear from researching co-creation methodologies is that the core principle of co-creation is that the activity happens in collaboration with a strong element of listening and inclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe practice of co-development and co-creation is not new, but it has risen in popularity within the context of media and storytelling. \u003cstrong\u003eWhat does an alternative to a single-author vision mean in the context of youth, data and technology?\u003c/strong\u003e Firstly, it creates a space for multiple perspectives—and importantly different perspectives—so that the blind spots in planning for uncertain digital futures can be inclusive of younger generations. And secondly, it allows for a deeper level of critical thinking and action around technology, resulting from participants’ ownership and self-authorship of the topics explored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/20221121_WTFW-diagrams-methodsprinciples.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram of core methods and principles\" title=\"Diagram of core methods and principles; visual by Yiorgos Bagakis\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eC﻿aption: Diagram of core methods and principles; visual by Yiorgos Bagakis\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite having extensive experience with partnerships and collaborations, Tactical Tech had not carried out co-creation with this age group before and so most of our approach was guided by partners, existing research and methodologies.

Here, in Part 2, we dive into the workshops we conducted and share principles and practices that informed the co-creation process and findings from the workshops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe What the Future Wants co-creation took the form of a workshop that was designed in three parts (explained below). We worked with six partners in the UK, Czech Republic, Ireland, Slovenia, North Macedonia, the Netherlands (and some associated partners in Germany, Turkey, Greece etc.). Approximately 200 young people (between the ages of 13 and 18) participated in around 10 workshops and were selected by our partners, both through existing networks and open calls. Some of the workshops were delivered by Tactical Tech in English, and in collaboration with the partners, and others were delivered independently by the partners, in their local language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe workshop was designed in three parts, three hours each (occasionally shortened where necessary by the partner), which expanded in scale and perspective (individual, group, societal, planetary) as the participants progressed. There were always a facilitator, a note-taker, and a tech supporter. The three parts were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital Natives:\u003c/strong\u003e There are many assumptions about young people and technology, but a lot of the time these assumptions are made from the outside looking in. This session is about young people’s perspective of technology, creating a space for them to share and reflect on experiences of growing up in a digital world, including the good, the bad, and their advice for future generations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital Influence:\u003c/strong\u003e Doom scrolling, profiling, herding—there are many hidden influencers behind screens that shape what individuals see and sometimes how people act. So what can young people do to influence the influencers?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital Ecosystem:\u003c/strong\u003e Technology is not neutral, and it is often intertwined with the society in which it’s built. Looking outwards to the wider web of issues that technology is part of, young people try to understand when technology helps and when it harms, and who gets to make those decisions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the first challenges was understanding the distinction between the different terms surrounding co-creation: ‘co-design’, ‘co-development’, ‘co-production’, which are often interchangeably used. A concern was that we could not claim co-creation if the created outputs were not directly designed and produced by the participants. However, it soon became clear that co-creation can take many forms and does not always result in co-design (the co-creation \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e design of a specific output within a community). Our approach of co-creation was focused on participatory action research, which we then used as the building blocks for creating the content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterlinked with this challenge was the dynamics of powerwhich are a recurring theme in co-creation analysis: ‘who decides the terms of engagement, what media is made and by whom, and why and who benefits from this type of project.\u003ca href=\"#_ftn1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e’(1) As the designers of the workshop, and the creators of the resulting exhibition, we had to be very careful to not set the agenda of the space. How can you encourage open and exploratory questions if you do not have a structure or a starting point? We soon found out that a structure is necessary, and within that structure you need activities that act as starting points for thought and exploration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/20221121_WTFW-favorite-leastfavorite_small.png\" alt=\"Visual of \u0026#x22;most and least favorite things\u0026#x22; as defined by our sample of young people\" title=\"Visual of \\\u0026#x22;most and least favorite things\\\u0026#x22; as defined by our sample of young people; courtesy of Dominika Knoblochová\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCaption: Visual of \"most and least favorite things\" as defined by our sample of young people; courtesy of Dominika Knoblochová\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWarm-up: Most and least favorite things about technology\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example of a simple activity used to warm up the sessions, we gave participants space to share with us how they experience technology by stating 1) their \u003cem\u003efavourite\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003ething about technology\u003c/em\u003e and 2) their \u003cem\u003eleast favourite thing about technology\u003c/em\u003e. They could answer both the questions or just one. The answers that emerged gave us a surface-level insight into the worlds they were inhabiting. Some of the \u003cem\u003efavourite\u003c/em\u003e things were simplelike  ‘sharing’, ‘finding inspiration’, ‘communication’, ‘organisation’, ‘(ability to) simplify tasks’. Others were more profound such as: ‘I don't know where I'd be if I wasn't able to create digital art and things like that’, \u003cem\u003e‘_technology can be a great way for people to get educated, to discover who they really are’, and ‘(my favourite thing) community, finding understanding, the possibility of expression’\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cem\u003e Their _least favourite\u003c/em\u003e aspects of technology revealed the darker side of their day to day experience and included ‘body shaming’, ‘doom scrolling’, ‘when it stops working’, ‘difficult to distinguish fake from reality’ , ‘no accountability’, ‘cyberbullying’ and ‘the most irritating thing for me are the rules that are now in place for the internet. Those are quite old. So yeah, there aren't really any rules for the internet we have right now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite this being a short warm up activity, we came back to the answers time and again to remind ourselves of the where the participants were coming from, how they were defining the issues and what they wanted to protect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eActivity: How others see you\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we used stereotypes or pre-existing narratives, we used them as a provocation. One activity the ‘Stereotype Spectogram’ used common tropes about teens and technology taken from media headlines: ‘Teenagers are addicted to technology’, ‘Technology harms teenagers’ mental health’ and ‘Teenagers are vulnerable to fake news’. This acted as a counter-space, an opportunity for the participants to orient themselves close to or far away from an assumption that the ‘other’ (the media, parents, teachers) had made about them. Using a spectrogram—a scale with ‘agree’ on one end and ‘disagree’ on the other, and everything in between—we asked the participants to place themselves and then explain their position. For example, ‘teenagers are addicted to technology’ resulted in a vibrant discussion that showed the nuanced and often complicated reality that was not reflected in the blanket headline:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘it depends what you mean when you say \"addicted\" I don't spend every single waking moment on my phone and I could survive without it for a while but I would not have fun at all, some people are just dependent on it for dopamine tbh’.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘Probably true, not exclusive or necessarily a problem’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘It's a problem for many, however it is slightly misunderstood, as it is an evolution of socializing.’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘although teenagers are easily influenced by technology, i think that not just teenagers, but adults can get addicted to technology as well.’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘as a teenager myself, a lot of times i find myself looking always for some way to reach technology’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘the question is whether it is addiction due to necessity or \"need\", sometimes technologies provide an escape from unpleasant reality, which can then cause addiction’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘I was out for dinner the other day, and there was a couple out to dinner together. Well, that girl was on her phone, and that boy was watching football. And they were just going out to dinner together on a date. And then I think: yes, where is it going.’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘So the younger you are, the more dependent on your phone you are and you can't think otherwise.’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘We teenagers can't live without a phone. A lot happens on the phone, you have friends over the phone. If all your friends are on your phone and you're not on it, they'll look at you weird too.’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA surprising observation was that with all the ‘stereotype’ statements resulted in a distribution of responses across the scale, there was almost never a majority agreement or disagreement to a statement and as the discussion unfolded, some participants shifted their perspective to be more inclusive of somebody else’s experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, when we introduced the statement ‘technology harms teenagers’ mental health’ there was a broad spectrum of responses, such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘it's hard to realize, it's happening slowly, it's sneaky’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘Technology gives teenagers too much pressure’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘For me i have a short attention span because I always look at instagram posts for like 5 seconds and just keep scrolling and so irl i cant stay focused for a long period of time’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘I actually think social media educates us about mental health’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emost of teenagers feel anxious just because of technology but at same time it can be exit from anxiety\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elike I said I don't know where I'd be without technology as so many things have helped my life for the better’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e‘I personally think it is very harmful. Because not only that teenagers deal with bullying at school, at the internet too. It also has super models on social media and u compare yourself to them which is mentally harmful.’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few insights came from these discussions. In particular, it became clear that there was an awareness about the issues that we presented, even if they were over-simplified. Also, although many of the answers on paper lacked clear nuance, when in discussion with the young participants, there was an implicit nuance emerging, which could then be used to adapt the subsequent activities to a level that challenged the group without pushing them in any direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eLessons Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting the expectations, from both the facilitator and participant perspective, is really important and finding a balance between opportunity and capacity is a good starting point. Many opportunities may arise from doing a co-creation process: perhaps there is an unexpectedly high level of engagement and commitment from the participants, or various networks are created as a result of the collaborations, and this creates the opportunity for further collaboration and engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point it’s important to ask: how much time commitment would that require? And do we have the capacity to carry out this additional collaboration in a sustainable and constructive way? To avoid unsustainable or aimless co-creation collaborations: communicate clearly (and early on) what is expected from the participants; decide on a start date and an end date for the co-creation process, or if there is no clear end-date, then state the reason for that; when new opportunities for collaboration present themselves, reflect on if there is enough capacity and time and, if they go ahead, then who is best suited to take them forward. It is very possible that at the point of closure, the participants can continue a form of co-creation or peer-to-peer learning independently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother challenge and learning was the documentation of the workshop. As the workshops were carried out by multiple partners in different formats, iterations and languages, we were not always able to thoroughly document the findings. An advantage of doing the workshops online was that it was much easier to capture the conversations and outcomes from group activities because they were centralised in one place, and on one platform. We also had one note-taker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ttc.io/s/tacticaltech.org/20221121_WTFW-laloma-setup.jpeg\" alt=\"What the Future Wants exhibition set-up\" title=\"What the Future Wants exhibition set-up; photo courtesy of La Loma\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eC﻿aption: What the Future Wants exhibition set-up; photo courtesy of La Loma\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the help of six partners, we ran around 10 of these co-creation workshops over the course of approximately 4 months in 2021, engaging approximately 200 young people (between the ages of 13 and 18). After compiling the results of the workshops, we at Tactical Tech analyzed common threads and particular areas of interest that recurred among the young people in these sessions. As it goes with Tactical Tech projects, the next steps involved several rounds of conceptualisation and iterations of our new resources. Some of the What the Future Wants materials matched with and were adapted from The Glass Room resources, while others were new and required research, development, prototyping and testing. Once the materials were finalized, the localization process followed. In Spring 2022, we launched \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://theglassroom.org/en/what-the-future-wants/\" title=\"https\\://theglassroom.org/en/what-the-future-wants/\"\u003eWhat the Future Wants\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and began the next steps of building additional partnerships to see how the materials could be used in communities around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-﻿--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOriginal essay written by Daisy Kidd. Thanks to Dominika Knoblochová for coordination and support during the co-creation process.
