  </p>

  <p>
    We reserve the right to modify the Terms of Use at any time, and without prior notice, by posting amended terms on this Site. Your continued use of the Steepster Service constitutes your acceptance of the amended Terms of Use.
  </p>

  <p>
    The term "Steepster" or "us" or "we" refers to the owner of the Site, Steepster Inc. The term "you" refers to the user or viewer of our Site.
  </p>

  <h2>Limitations of Use</h2>

  <p>
    Your license for access and use of the Steepster Site and any information, materials and documents therein are subject to the following restrictions and prohibitions on use. a)You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, republish, display, post, or transmit any material contained on the Site in any form or by any means, including, but not limited to, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, or otherwise, without the express prior written consent of Steepster. b) You may not use the Site or any materials obtained from the Site to develop, or as a component of, or in connection with any information, storage and retrieval system, database, information base, or similar resource (in any media now existing or hereafter developed), that is offered for commercial distribution of any kind, including through sale, lease, license, rental, subscription, or any other commercial distribution mechanism. You also may not "mirror" any material contained on the Site on any other server. Any unauthorized use of any content on this Site may violate copyright laws, trademark laws, the laws of privacy and publicity, and communications statutes and regulations. Elements of the Site that are licensed by Steepster are subject to the same restrictions and prohibitions on use.
  </p>

  <h2>Access to Service</h2>

  <p>
    Use of manual or automated software, devices, or other processes to "crawl" or "spider" any web pages contained in the Site is strictly prohibited. You agree not to monitor or copy, or allow others to monitor or copy, our web pages or the content included herein. You also agree not to "frame" or otherwise simulate the appearance or function of this Site. Furthermore, you agree not to take any action that interferes with the proper working of or places an unreasonable load on our infrastructure, including but not limited to unsolicited communications, attempts to gain unauthorized access, or transmission or activation of computer viruses.
  </p>

  <h2>Links to Third Party Sites</h2>

  <p>
    The Site may contain links to web sites controlled, owned, and operated by third parties (the "third-party sites"). Steepster cannot control and has no responsibility for the accuracy or availability of information provided on third-party sites. You acknowledge that use of any third-party sites is governed by the terms of use for those websites, and not by these Terms of Use. Links to third-party sites do not constitute an endorsement or recommendation by Steepster of such sites or the content, products, advertising or other materials presented on such sites, but are only for your convenience and you access them at your own risk. Such third-party sites may have a privacy policy different from that of Steepster and may provide less security than this Site. We are not responsible for the content of any third-party sites, nor do we make any warranties or representations, express or implied, regarding the content (or the accuracy of such content) on any third-party sites, and Steepster shall have no liability of any nature whatsoever for any failure of products or services offered or advertised at such sites or otherwise.

  </p>

  <h2>Indemnification</h2>

  <p>
    By accepting the Terms of Use, you agree to indemnify and otherwise hold harmless Steepster, its officers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, managers, employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns from any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential exemplary or other damages, including, without limitation attorneys' fees and court costs, resulting from your use of the Steepster Site.
  </p>

  <h2>Termination</h2>

  <p>
    You agree that Steepster may, with or without cause, immediately terminate your Steepster account and access to the services provided by or available from Steepster ("Steepster Services") without prior notice.
