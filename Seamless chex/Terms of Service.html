SeamlessChex shall own all rights, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to any improvements to the existing SeamlessChex products or services and/or any new programs, upgrades, modifications or enhancements developed by SeamlessChex in connection with rendering any Service to you, even when the same result from yours request.  To the extent, if any, that ownership in such refinements and improvements does not automatically vest in SeamlessChex by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, you hereby transfer and assign (and, if applicable, shall cause its affiliates to transfer and assign) to SeamlessChex all rights, title, and interest which you or any of its affiliates may have in and to such refinements and improvements.  You will take all necessary action to assure SeamlessChex’s property rights to its Intellectual Property Rights and any extensions thereunder will be protected.<br/><br/><strong>Article 15: Modification</strong><br/>SeamlessChex reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify, discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that SeamlessChex shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. <br/><br/><strong>Article 16 Termination and Cancellation</strong><br/>The initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period of two (2) years, commencing on the date first set forth below.  This Agreement shall thereafter be automatically renewed for additional terms of one (1) year each unless either party notifies the other no later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the current term that it does not wish to renew this Agreement.   SeamlessChex may cancel this Agreement for any reason, or no reason at all, by providing you with seven (7) days notice. If you violate any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, by not paying required amounts to SeamlessChex, you shall remain responsible for payment of all the remaining fees and costs that would have otherwise been due for the remainder of the then-current term.  The parties expressly agree that the damages, which they might reasonably anticipate to be sustained by SeamlessChex, are difficult to ascertain and measure because of their indefiniteness or uncertainty and that the amount set forth above is a reasonable estimate of the damages that would probably be caused and shall be due regardless of proof of actual damages.  All other provisions of this Agreement which may reasonably be construed as surviving such termination will survive the termination of this Agreement, including, but not limited to paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.<br/><br/><strong>Article 17 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Arbitration</strong><br/>This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to conflict of law provisions. Any action, proceeding, arbitration or mediation relating to or arising from this Agreement must be brought, held, or otherwise occur in the federal judicial district that includes New York. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. IT PROVIDES THAT ANY DISPUTE MAY BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. Any claim, dispute or controversy (&quot;Claim&quot;) by either you or us against the other, or against the employees, agents, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, beneficiaries, agents or assigns of the other, arising from or relating in any way to this Agreement or to our relationship, including Claims regarding the applicability of this arbitration clause or the validity of the entire Agreement, shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association, under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the Claim is filed, except as otherwise provided below. All Claims are subject to arbitration, no matter what theory they are based on or what remedy they seek. This includes Claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or our negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other sources of law. Claims and remedies sought as part of a class action, private attorney general or other representative action are subject to arbitration on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator and will be limited solely to the Claim between you and us. The arbitration, or any portion of it, will not be consolidated with any other arbitration and will not be conducted on a class-wide or class action basis. If either party prevails in the arbitration of any Claim against the other, the non-prevailing party will reimburse the prevailing party for any fees it paid to the American Arbitration Association in connection with the arbitration, as well as for any reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such arbitration. Any decision rendered in such arbitration proceedings will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction. Any arbitration hearing at which you appear will take place at a location within the federal judicial district that includes New York. This arbitration agreement applies to all Claims now in existence or that may arise in the future. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent any party&#x27;s use of (or advancement of any Claims, defenses or offsets in) bankruptcy or repossession, replevin, judicial foreclosure or any other prejudgment or provisional remedy relating to any collateral, security or other property interests for contractual debts now or hereafter owed by either party to the other. IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND SEAMLESSCHEX MAY OTHERWISE HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR A JURY, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE OR BE REPRESENTED IN LITIGATION FILED IN COURT BY OTHERS (INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS), BUT EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED ABOVE, THOSE RIGHTS, INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, ARE WAIVED AND ALL CLAIMS MUST NOW BE RESOLVED THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOU AND SEAMLESSCHEX AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.<br/><br/><strong>Article 18: Force Majeure</strong><br/>Any delay or failure of either party to perform its obligations will be excused to the extent that the delay or failure was caused solely and directly by an event beyond such party’s control, without such party’s fault or negligence and that by its nature could not have been foreseen by such party or, if it could have been foreseen, was unavoidable (which events may include natural disasters, embargoes, explosions, riots, wars, or acts of terrorism) (each, a “Force Majeure Event”). However, your financial inability to perform; changes in cost or availability of materials, components or services; change in market conditions; or labor disputes or other contract disputes involving or affecting you will not excuse performance by you under this section, and will not constitute a Force Majeure Event. A party shall give the other party prompt written notice of any event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to result in a Force Majeure Event, and the anticipated duration of such Force Majeure Event. A party shall use all diligent efforts to end the Force Majeure Event, ensure that the effects of the Force Majeure Event are minimized, and resume full performance under the Agreement as soon as commercially reasonable. We are permitted (but not required) to procure substitute goods or services for any goods or services that are delayed or unavailable as a result of a Force Majeure Event. <br/><br/><strong>Article 19: General Terms</strong><br/>You acknowledge, understand, and agree that the Agreement, this agreement, and our relationship is non-exclusive. Nothing in the Agreement or otherwise shall in any way limit our right to do business with others and/or allow access and/or use of the Services by others.  If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions not so declared shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect, but shall be construed in a manner so as to effectuate the intent of this Agreement as a whole, notwithstanding such stricken provision or provisions.  No provision of this Agreement shall be construed against any party merely because that party or counsel drafted or revised the provision in question.  All parties have been advised and have had an opportunity to consult with legal counsel of their choosing regarding the force and effect of the terms set forth herein.  This Agreement shall be deemed to be jointly prepared by the parties and therefore any ambiguity or uncertainty shall be interpreted accordingly.  No term or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed waived and no breach excused, unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party claimed to have waived or consented.  Any consent by any party to, or waiver of, a breach by the other party, whether express or implied, shall not constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any different or subsequent breach.  You may not assign this Agreement without the written consent of SeamlessChex.  SeamlessChex may assign this Agreement in its sole discretion without the written consent of you.  The section headings contained in this Agreement are for convenient reference only, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  This Agreement, including all schedules, exhibits and attachments thereto, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior agreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, representations or warranties, whether oral or written, by any officer, partner, employee or representative of any party hereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure only to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer or shall be deemed to confer upon any persons or entities not parties to this Agreement, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (irrespective of its choice of law principles).  This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same the same instrument.  Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, e.g., www.docusign.com) or other transmission method and any counterpart so delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.  By executing this Agreement by electronic means, Agent acknowledges that under the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign), this Agreement and all electronically executed documents incorporated into this Agreement or related hereto are legally binding in the same manner as are hard copy documents executed by hand signature when (i) your electronic signature is associated with the Agreement and the incorporated or related documents, (ii) you consents and intends to be bound by the Agreement and the incorporated or related documents, and (iii) the Agreement is delivered in an electronic record capable of retention by the recipient at the time of receipt (i.e., print or otherwise store the electronic record).<br/>‍</div><div><div class="div-block-331"></div></div></div></div><div class="section-28"><div class="container-7 w-container"><h2 class="heading-6">Discover The Payment Processing Solution
